<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>SERMON
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DEPENDENCE UPON GOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Philippians</span>, <span class="smcap">iv</span>.,
5, 6.</p>
<p><i>The Lord is at hand</i>.&nbsp; <i>Be careful for
nothing</i>; <i>but in everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto</i> God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> Lord is at
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is doubtful whether this admonition is
designed to recommend the foregoing precept, &ldquo;Let your
moderation be known unto all men,&rdquo; or whether it introduces
and enforces the injunction, &ldquo;Be careful for
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may well do both: on the one hand,
exhorting the disciples to lead (and that manifestly) an
unworldly life, seeing they were so shortly to be taken out of
the world; and, on the other hand, cheering them in their
sorrows, suppressing their anxieties and quickening their faith,
by the remembrance, that comfort, and peace, and perfect bliss
would soon be theirs&mdash;&ldquo;The <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> is at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The
second advent of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was always
in the mind of the apostles.&nbsp; It is thought that they even
counted upon its literal occurrence in their lifetime, as though
the prophecies of it were among the things to be fulfilled before
that generation passed away.&nbsp; Without subscribing to this
view, against which many objections may be taken, it may be
readily admitted that, as they were uncertain how soon it might
happen, as they had no ground for concluding that it would
<i>not</i> be in their time, so they rightly laboured to impress
upon the disciples its <i>possible</i>, if you will its
<i>probable</i> nearness.&nbsp; Besides, they knew that,
virtually, it would be soon: for if <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> came not speedily in the flesh,
speedily they would be called out of the flesh to Him, and then
would cease the pleasures and cares of this world, and then would
begin the possession and enjoyment of things eternal.&nbsp; How
necessary then, that they who were but pilgrims and strangers
here, living a life that was soon to be ended and accounted for,
should be warned against excess of worldliness, against building
houses where they were but permitted to pitch tents, against
turning aside out of the path of pilgrimage, and wasting or
abusing the time for journeying!&nbsp; How cheering, too, for
those who were perplexed, or burthened, <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>or afflicted, to be reminded that
perplexity, and toil, and grief were only passing clouds, and
mere inconveniences by the way&mdash;that soon they should be rid
of them altogether, and should only be allowed to remember them
to magnify their appreciation of attained rest and glory!&nbsp;
And here let me observe, that the admonition &ldquo;Be careful
for nothing,&rdquo; is not in this place a reproof of the
worldling, coming across him in the path of mammon worship, of
earthly aggrandisement, of forgetfulness of eternity, of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, of heaven, but is rather a consolation,
an encouragement, for those, who while walking, or endeavouring
to walk, in the right way, are depressed and hindered by trials,
and perplexities, and afflictions.&nbsp; There are cares which
man makes for himself, for which he is to be blamed, whereof he
deserves to eat the bitter fruit.&nbsp; There are other cares
which he suffers involuntarily, which <span
class="smcap">God</span> imposes upon him as discipline, which
Satan thrusts upon him as temptations.&nbsp; With regard to the
last, the Christian&rsquo;s cares, St. Paul offers advice and
consolation, saying in effect&mdash;Sink not beneath them, poor
pilgrim; groan not on account of them; let them not distract your
aims and desires from the right object of solicitude and
hope.&nbsp; Weigh them in the right scales against the glories <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>that are
coming, and they will surely be found light.&nbsp; Measure them
beside the joys of eternity, and they will be seen to be brief
and transitory.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
is at hand&rdquo; to relieve you of them all, at His second
advent, by the unclothing of death, by carrying you to
Paradise.&nbsp; Be comforted, rejoice, rouse ye, and, without
distraction, pursue your hopeful course.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be careful
for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know the force of such an exhortation in earthly
things.&nbsp; We know by experience how light is the labour which
leads to rest, how possible it is to smile through present tears
at the prospect of coming joy; what pains, and self-denials, and
dangers, and encounters, are readily embraced by those whom
ambition prompts, and approval cheers, and reward awaits.&nbsp;
Nothing is too hard to bear, nothing too dear to relinquish,
nothing too formidable to meet, nothing too much to do; the hands
that hung down are lifted up, the sorrow is banished, the toil
becomes pleasure, we rush to the fight, we delight in the race,
forgetting the past, disregarding the present, hastening onward
to the future, the rest, the victory, the prize, the glory.&nbsp;
It is easy, then&mdash;not altogether, but comparatively&mdash;to
obey the precept, &ldquo;Be careful for nothing&rdquo; in view of
the prospect, &ldquo;The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is at
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>But,
after all, I cannot but think that something better than a
prospect is hinted at in the text.&nbsp; The apostle goes on to
urge, &ldquo;In everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not say,
&ldquo;Make light of present cases, on account of coming
consolation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not bid the downcast lift up
their eyes to the hills, whence by and by cometh their
help.&nbsp; It is not &ldquo;Bear, endure, encounter in
hope,&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Get rid of what burthens you, by laying
it upon Him, Who is near, by your side now, to take it.&nbsp; Be
careful for nothing; put every care upon <span
class="smcap">God</span> (the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> who
is at hand to take it), by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving.&rdquo;&nbsp; I say this is something better than a
prospect; better, because of its superior influence, and better,
because of the immediate relief.&nbsp; The teaching of Advent,
all important as it is, too often affects but little such poor
creatures of the present as we are.&nbsp; We are exhorted to look
back to the first coming of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, to
see what He suffered and did for us, what a foundation He laid
for us to build on.&nbsp; We are exhorted to look forward to the
second advent, to consider what <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
will do, to anticipate the glorious completion of us in Him as
the building of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; We obey,
and we are <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>moved to faint gratitude for the one, to faint hope of
the other.&nbsp; The retrospect and the prospect considered, we
both see from what rock we were hewn, and into how beautiful a
fabric we shall be fashioned; and, unless we are very incapable
of feeling, in the view of past and future, we strive to accept
thankfully and to sanctify duly the present.&nbsp; But, oh! how
little constraining is the influence of a Saviour who <i>once</i>
visited the earth, of a Judge who shall <i>by and by</i> visit
it!&nbsp; How dim is the remembrance of long past mercies! how
distant is the prospect of heavenly consolations!&nbsp; Earth is
now present with all its attractions and rewards.&nbsp; The
world, the flesh, and the devil are now assailing and afflicting
us with their many temptations.&nbsp; How can we resist the seen,
and heard, and felt fascinations?&nbsp; How can we fill up the
present void, and lull the present pain, and endure the pressing
trial, by proposing to ourselves the hopes of the future?&nbsp;
Does the promise of food to-morrow fill the hungry to-day?&nbsp;
Does the sight of the physician&rsquo;s prescription on the
instant stay the pain and progress of inflammation?&nbsp; Will a
drowning man float till by and by a rope is brought and thrown to
him?&nbsp; Will a discomfited army rally and conquer, because
reinforcements at some future time <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>will reach the field?&nbsp; In each of
these cases, the prospect will have <i>some</i> influence, but
will it be adequate to the occasion?&nbsp; Must not the present
be met by the present?&nbsp; Do we not need, besides a Saviour of
the past, and a Judge of the future, a <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> of the present?&nbsp; Yes, verily, and
we are assured that we have Him in the words, &ldquo;The <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> is at hand,&rdquo; and advised how to
avail ourselves of Him in what follows, &ldquo;Be careful for
nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are too apt to have but a religion of the future; to forget
that there is <i>at hand</i> a <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
and Helper; to act as though the first opportunity of serving
<span class="smcap">God</span> were in the hour of death, as
though the blessings of reward and favour were only to be had in
heaven; to treat <span class="smcap">God</span>, in short, as if
He were only the <span class="smcap">God</span> of a future
world.&nbsp; Such teaching as that of the text reproves and
corrects us.&nbsp; As other passages of Holy Writ instruct us to
make <span class="smcap">God</span> the aim of this present life,
using life as an apprentice-time to the profession of
Christianity, as a season wherein to prove ourselves and be
proved, and to set forth His glory; &ldquo;Whether we live, we
live unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of <span
class="smcap">God</span>;&rdquo; so the text bids us make <span
class="smcap">God</span> the guide and supporter of this
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;In everything by prayer, with supplication,
and thanksgiving, let your requests be made known as to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And the peace of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, which passeth all understanding, shall
keep your hearts and minds through <span class="smcap">Christ
Jesus</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what we want to feel and act upon, that <span
class="smcap">God</span> is a <span class="smcap">God</span> at
hand, and not a <span class="smcap">God</span> afar off; that we
may <i>now</i> cast all our care upon Him, knowing that He careth
for us; that if we lay our burthen upon the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, He will <i>now</i> sustain us: that if
we commit our way unto Him, He will bring it to pass; that He
waits to be gracious, not till this life is over, but only till
we make known our requests, till we pray and supplicate, and give
thanks.&nbsp; In proportion as we do not realise and act upon
these assurances, we are blind to many of the charms, and
insensible to many of the helps and comforts of our holy
religion: we frustrate, too, the fulfilment in ourselves of the
truth, that godliness has the promise of the life that now is: we
run the risk of becoming earthly-minded, of being swallowed up of
overmuch sorrow, of being cumbered with many cares, of being
snared away and taken captive by the devil, of making shipwreck
of our faith.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>O
brethren, do not suppose that <span class="smcap">God</span> only
dwells on the margin of the haven, that we are left to steer our
course, to buffet with the waves, to struggle against the storm,
to repair the shivered mast, to stop the leakages, to sail into
the harbour, and let down the anchor, and disembark upon the
shore before He meets us.&nbsp; With Him as our Captain we are to
set out.&nbsp; He as our pilot must guide us.&nbsp; He must rule
the waves and bring us through them.&nbsp; The way is His, as the
haven is His; unless He is with us throughout the first, we shall
never reach the last.&nbsp; Grace is no reserved blessing.&nbsp;
Heaven is no distant home.&nbsp; Grace is ever to be had if we
will seek it.&nbsp; Heaven is everywhere, if we will but realise
it, for where <span class="smcap">God</span> is, is heaven.</p>
<p>But <span class="smcap">God</span> is not manifest to
all.&nbsp; His help is not given unsought.&nbsp; The eye of faith
alone can see Him, the cry of faith alone be heard.&nbsp; As He
will be served for reward, so will He be asked for grace: we must
be alert to see what help we want; we must be prompt to seek
it.&nbsp; We must acknowledge Him, or He will not guide us.&nbsp;
We must cast our care upon Him, or He will not take it.&nbsp;
Unless we are careful for nothing, because we have committed our
cares to Him, we must be full of cares, harassed by them,
troubled, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>afflicted, distressed; or, being careless, we shall be
deemed worthless, and left to drift upon shoals and into
quicksands, and to sink in the gulf of destruction.</p>
<p>Do I speak to those who are careful for many things?&nbsp; I
do not mean those who are concerning themselves about worldly
schemes, who would increase their wealth, their power, or their
pleasure, who, regarding earth as their home, and resolving to
make the most of it, are laying themselves out for many days,
proposing to pull down their barns and build greater, to make to
themselves a name, who are intent upon what they shall eat and
drink, and wherewithal they shall be clothed, how they shall get
their full of pleasure, how they shall cull all the advantages,
and avoid all the disagreeables of life.&nbsp; As the minister of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, I have nothing to do with these,
further than to cry out upon their folly and their sin, and to
warn them that unless they repent and relinquish their cares,
they shall be consumed by them.&nbsp; But do I speak to those who
setting before them as the business of life, the service of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, as the end of life, the glory of
heaven, are yet, by personal infirmity, by peculiar exigencies,
and difficulties, and anxieties, by a frowning or fascinating
world, by the wiles of Satan or by any other <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>means, so
troubled, so distracted, so drawn off from the pursuit of their
object, and the entertaining of their hopes, that they find
themselves carnal when they would be spiritual, standing still
when they would be moving on, clinging to earth when they would
be rising to heaven, waging war when they would be enjoying
peace?&nbsp; Do I speak to those whose weak and carnal nature
will not be enlisted in the hearty pursuit of godliness; whose
crying temporal wants distract, and deafen, and deaden the
yearnings of their better nature; whose occupation in the world
seems to contend, and too successfully, for the best of their
thoughts and aims, whose natural losses and deprivations sadden
and absorb them, creating a void which they cannot fill, taking
away a guide whom they used to look to, a support upon which they
were wont to lean; whose patient labours in well-doing have
failed of success; whose good is evil spoken of; whose many cares
to train aright the children whom <span class="smcap">God</span>
gave them, have been repaid by waywardness; whose conscientious
well-doing has brought upon them what should rather be the reward
of ungodliness; who, in short, have not found in religion what
they hoped for and honestly sought, and who cannot render to
religion what they would?&nbsp; Do I speak to these?&nbsp; Well!
I ask, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Have you sought to get rid of care, by casting it upon
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>? or have you rather asked
human counsel, and leant upon human support, and hewn out for
yourselves cisterns, and built for yourselves a refuge, instead
of running into the refuge of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Have you animated yourselves only
by the thought of distant help, of future peace?&nbsp; Have you
lost sight of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> at hand, the
<span class="smcap">God</span> of Providence, knowing, causing or
assenting to, and waiting to guide, as you ask or ask not, the
circumstances which try you?&nbsp; Have you realised that nothing
happens but by His consent, and that His consent is given or
withheld, not by what He sees of you, but by what He hears from
you?&nbsp; Do you pray&mdash;not simply uttering certain words
put into your mouths in Church formularies, or books of private
devotion, not framing acts of general adoration, of vague
acknowledgments of dependence and prayer for blessings, but
presenting yourselves, in the utterance of your own feelings, as
in all things the servants of His will, the dependents and
petitioners of His grace?&nbsp; Do you supplicate?&nbsp; Is each
ascertained want laid before Him in all its detail?&nbsp; Is
every hindrance, every difficulty, every desire made known to Him
as soon as perceived by yourselves?&nbsp; Is your care <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>cast upon
Him?&nbsp; Is He besought to take it, to relieve you of it, to
tell you what to do respecting it?&nbsp; Can you say of all that
now tries you, that nothing is uncommunicated to Him, no relief,
no guidance unsought?&nbsp; And do you in everything give
thanks.&nbsp; Ah, here, brethren, is the test!&nbsp; Here
doubtless will many of you, who are clear hitherto, be obliged to
plead guilty.&nbsp; You do not give thanks.&nbsp; You recognise
<span class="smcap">God</span> as Him from whom you may seek
all.&nbsp; You do not sufficiently acknowledge what you have
received.&nbsp; Of many special gifts, of power to bear with many
trials, of guidance in various difficulties, of blessings
continued and troubles not made worse (an important item), you
make no acknowledgment.&nbsp; You know of many blessings for
which you ought to be grateful: you may guess at many more, and
besides there are many which you do not know, and cannot guess
at, which yet doubtless have been poured out upon you, or at
least have not been taken away from you.&nbsp; What of
these?&nbsp; What of everything good in itself, or capable of
being made good?&nbsp; What of the temptations, what of the
afflicting providences of which you are the objects?&nbsp; You do
not think, perhaps, that these are things to be grateful for:
but, remember, the command is, &ldquo;In everything with <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>thanksgiving.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, the prayer, without the
thanksgiving, is not prayer.&nbsp; It is only part
dependence.&nbsp; It asks, it does not acknowledge.&nbsp; It does
not rejoice that <span class="smcap">God</span> is yet operating;
that He is chastening if He is not rewarding; that therefore, you
are still the creatures of His providence, and may hope for
blessing if you do not frustrate it.</p>
<p>O mend all that is amiss, quicken all that is slow, revive all
that is ready to perish.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> is at hand.&nbsp; Cast all your care
upon Him.&nbsp; Trust in the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with
all your heart, and lean not to your own understanding.&nbsp; In
all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your
paths.&nbsp; In everything by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving let your requests be made known to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; See Him by faith Who is invisible
to natural eye.&nbsp; Lean on Him Whom the arm of flesh cannot
touch.&nbsp; Speak to Him in all your circumstances of weal or
woe, of trial or blessing.&nbsp; Pray to Him for what you want,
and acknowledge all that you receive, of whatever kind, and ask
Him what use to make of it.&nbsp; So rid yourselves of your
cares, and then&mdash;I do not say that you shall be left without
trials, for <span class="smcap">God</span> does not promise that,
rather does He lead us to expect trials as the signs and pledges
of His love, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>but I do say that He will give you nothing, and leave
you nothing, but what is good for your personal happiness and
your eternal interest, and that in every trial, whether sent by
Him, or allowed to be inflicted by the agents of evil, He will
give you support, and guidance, and ardent hope, and abundant
consolation; yea, He will bestow on you His peace which passeth
understanding, and which, whatever your circumstances, shall
assuredly keep your hearts and minds through <span
class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>, unto eternal salvation.</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

17.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Where is the God of
Judgment</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prophet had been complaining of
the priests for neglecting to inform and correct the people, and
of the people for disregarding <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> teaching.&nbsp; Reasoning and
remonstrating with them, and supposing them to attempt
self-justification, he tells them at last that they have wearied
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> with their words&mdash;by
which he means their acted and thought words rather than what
they spoke&mdash;and in answer to the question, which he knows
they would put, &ldquo;Wherein have we wearied Him?&rdquo; he
says, By presuming licentiously that <span
class="smcap">God</span> is indifferent alike to good and evil,
and has no moral likings or dislikings&mdash;&ldquo;When ye say
every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, and He delighteth in
them,&rdquo;&mdash;or, if it were otherwise, that at least He
does <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>not
act upon His feeling&mdash;&ldquo;Where is the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment?&rdquo; the manifestation of
the discriminating, the rewarding, or punishing <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; I do not propose to enlarge upon
the text in its historic relation to the Jews, but, applying it
to ourselves, to show, first, that the question, &ldquo;Where is
the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment?&rdquo; is one
which we Christians often ask in perverse unbelief, or in sad
infirmity; and, secondly, that the question is one which in a
better sense we should often ask (as we do not), in order to
discern His operations, to become acquainted and impressed with
the truth, that there is a judgment of all, <i>here</i> and
<i>hereafter</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the <span class="smcap">God</span> of
Judgment?&rdquo;&nbsp; I say that this question is often asked in
perverse unbelief, or in sad infirmity.&nbsp; Practically, we too
often ignore the idea of judgment altogether.&nbsp; Our reason
suggests to us, that if there is a moral governor of the world,
then surely good will be approved by reward, and evil marked by
punishment.&nbsp; The Bible plainly and most positively assures
us, that, as rational and responsible creatures of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> hand, we are subject to a
judgment which His goodness, His truth, His justice, His
holiness, cannot omit to pass on our every act, and word, and
thought; that as purchased servants of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, we are set a certain work to do, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>with the
express understanding that we shall be faithfully dealt with
according to our treatment of that work, and are put upon a
probation whereof at the end <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
<i>must</i> take account, for He has been made <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> and Judge for that very end, and has
received a commission from the Father, which He may in no single
instance depart from.&nbsp; Yea, more than that, it tells us that
the immediate effect on us, of all our good and evil, is
<i>itself</i> a judgment, contributing to the formation of the
character which shall adapt us, and so consign us, to heaven or
to hell.&nbsp; I say reason and the Bible so instructs us; and
yet we practically ignore the judgment.&nbsp; Of course I do not
mean that we strike it out of our creed, that we do otherwise
than assent to it in theory, that we altogether forget it in
practice, but that we do not make it the ruling principle of our
lives&mdash;the impelling or restraining influence of every
thought and deed.&nbsp; Am I not right?&nbsp; Reflect, dear
brethren, how many wrong things you do or desire, with little
hesitation, with no compunction, with no fear of judgment!&nbsp;
Reflect, too, how many good things you pass over or forego, or
will take no trouble to attain, through want of consideration of
the reward that belongs to them, and which therefore you are
losing!&nbsp; How ready are <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>you to taste each cup of pleasure, to
be engrossed with the pursuits of this world, to withhold what
you should part with, to do what is wrong, to omit what is
enjoined, in forgetfulness of the fact that for all these things
<span class="smcap">God</span> will bring you unto
judgment!&nbsp; How impatient, too, under trials, how slow in
spiritual work, how little interested in the love and attainment
of godliness; as though these things were all loss, and
suffering, and uninviting toil; as though there were no
recompense of reward!&nbsp; Yes, there is something in the best
of us, and much in the most of us, of practical disregard of
judgment.&nbsp; Of course we know (and are in a measure
influenced by the knowledge) that by and by we shall stand before
<span class="smcap">God</span>, to be blessed or
cursed&mdash;that it is necessary, therefore, to secure a good
hope of acceptance, and to make our peace with <span
class="smcap">God</span> through <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>, and that this is to be done by keeping all the
ordinances of religion, and obeying in spirit the whole moral
code, and striving to love and serve the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> now; or at least by repenting of all
that is amiss, and praying earnestly for pardon and quickening of
our faith, before we die.&nbsp; But still, it is not a
<i>judgment</i> that we contemplate&mdash;a real scrutiny of our
life&rsquo;s ways&mdash;an actual weighing of us in the heavenly
balance, that we may be rewarded or <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>punished for those ways, and accepted
or rejected according to our actual state.&nbsp; We are wont to
consider <span class="smcap">God</span> as an arbitrary Being,
not absolutely bound by any laws, or promises, or threats, but
free to treat us as He will, and disposed, for <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> sake, to be favourable to
us&mdash;if we ask Him&mdash;without any regard to what we have
been doing, and what we actually are.&nbsp; I am not sure that
you will admit this.&nbsp; But, brethren, to help you to do so,
consider how general is a vague trust to <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> merits&mdash;and <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> goodness on account of those
merits&mdash;to cover all excesses and defects of duty, to accept
any kind of character, as though there were no rule of reward,
and no necessary qualification for heaven!&nbsp; How rare is the
conviction, that while <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
merits are indeed the only ground of our acceptance, and <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> mercy is exercised on account of
those merits, yet the merits and the mercy are applied to us on
condition that we do certain works, and attain to a certain
character in the strength of the Holy Spirit given to incline and
enable us; that we are to be rewarded or punished, accepted or
rejected, strictly according to the terms of that condition, and
that the inquiry into its observance, in the scrutiny of our past
lives and of our present state, in the pronouncing of them such
as they were <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>appointed to be, or the opposite, and the bestowal of
the reward or punishment, is a strict judgment, in the passing of
which the Judge has no room for arbitrary favour, no option, if I
may so speak, to do otherwise than, in view of the evidence, to
apply the fixed law&mdash;life for those whom it approves, death
for those whom it condemns.</p>
<p>Oh! there is a <span class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment, and
to us Christians there is no other <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
is full of merits.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> accepts
those merits, and is full of mercy on account of them.&nbsp; We
cannot magnify the merits too much, nor rejoice too much in the
mercy; provided (but provided only) that we remember that they
are applied by rule, and that we must observe the rule, and be
sure that <span class="smcap">God</span> will in no wise, and in
no case, depart from it.&nbsp; Trust to <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> merits; hope for <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> mercy, but count most surely on
judgment, as you are most surely the objects of it.</p>
<p>But, secondly, fully believing that there is a <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment, the questions arise, Where
is He?&nbsp; In what court does He sit?&nbsp; When does He
judge?&nbsp; The common notion (and my remarks have hitherto
fallen in with it) is, that He is only in a future world, and
that He will not exercise His office till the last day.&nbsp; The
notion is founded on a truth.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> sits on the throne of <span
class="smcap">God</span> <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>now, to send down grace, to intercede
with the Father, to rule the Church.&nbsp; At the last day, and
not before, He will leave that throne, and come forth in His
glorious majesty to judge the quick and the dead, and to dispose
of them in their appointed eternal abodes.&nbsp; We have a work
to do, and a day set us to do it in, and account will not be
taken of it, and the hire given us, till the day is over.&nbsp;
There is a character to be formed ere we can enter heaven, and
space, and opportunity, and power, are vouchsafed us for forming
it.&nbsp; Respecting these, then, judgment tarrieth.&nbsp; And
even when our individual time is over, when our work ceases, and
our probation closes, there are others left to work and fashion
themselves for eternity; and <span class="smcap">God</span> has
appointed that we, without them, shall not be made perfect.&nbsp;
There is to be but one glorious descent from the throne, one
general resurrection, one great assize, one gathering of the
saints into the highest heaven, one opening, and then one
shutting for ever of the lowest hell.&nbsp; When our day is over,
we must, probably, as others do, sleep a night in the grave, and
then on the morning of the Resurrection shall appear the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment.&nbsp; But surely, after
all, there must be an earlier judgment!&nbsp; When the body is
laid down, and begins its <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>sleep, the soul does not lie down and
sleep with it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The body returns to the dust,&rdquo;
we are told, &ldquo;but the spirit goes back to <span
class="smcap">God</span> who gave it;&rdquo; and lest we should
imagine that this is but a figurative way of describing a
suspension of the spirit&rsquo;s life, we are informed in many
places not only that it continues greatly alive and awake,
requiring a place of conscious abode, but that it is at once
disposed of by <span class="smcap">God</span>, and in a manner
which shows an immediate judgment of it.&nbsp; As soon as Lazarus
died, he was carried to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, and there was
comforted: as soon as Dives died, in hell (a place of misery of
some kind) he lift up his eyes, being in torments.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This day shalt thou be with Me in Paradise,&rdquo; was the
promise of Him, Who could not promise idly.&nbsp; To be absent
from the body is, for the saint, to be present with the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, and a vision showed St. John the souls
of the martyrs living and pleading beneath the altar.&nbsp; What
does all this teach us, but that the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment meets us at the gate of
death, and there and then judges and disposes of us?&nbsp; It is
somewhat speculative to inquire what is the nature of the
judgment.&nbsp; It is beyond us to understand how an immediate
judgment is compatible with a future one.&nbsp; We know not
whether <span class="smcap">God</span> at first privately
intimates what He will at last publicly <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>pronounce;
whether this is the actual, that only the formal decision;
whether the scrutiny is now made, or only rehearsed; whether the
soul is actually tried, or only committed for trial, and in the
mean time so dealt with by immediate imprisonment, or liberation
on pledge to appear, as to hint, rather than plainly declare what
shall be its ultimate fate; whether it enters at once into a
state of actual, though partial, experience of joy or misery,
companying with <span class="smcap">God</span>, with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, with holy angels, or with Satan and
evil spirits; or whether it is left in an antechamber where it
but anticipates the future reward, and actually receives none of
it.&nbsp; All this is mystery.&nbsp; But certain we are,
brethren, that death, is in some sense the time of judgment, and
consequently that in some way, at the very moment of departure
from this life we are confronted with the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment.&nbsp; Oh, that we could
feel this!&nbsp; What a precious time and talent it would make
our life; what an awful antechamber of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> presence!&nbsp; How we should be
deterred from doing evil; how stirred to do good!&nbsp; How
should we be watching, staff in hand; how resolutely should we do
our work, how patiently should we suffer!&nbsp; Could we then be
at home in the world, prone to sinful pleasures, distracted or
engrossed <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>by worldly cares, indifferent to sin and holiness?&nbsp;
No, it would be impossible!&nbsp; Could we be idle, if we knew
that our work would so soon be scrutinised?&nbsp; Could we delay
the cultivation of a grace necessary for heaven, if we knew that
the time for acquiring it might so soon be over?&nbsp; Could we
hazard the interests of eternity, if we knew that we were
separated from them, not by a wide and lasting world, not by
many, many years of forgetfulness in the grave, but only by a
thin veil, through which they might even now be albut heard and
seen, which the next moment might be rent in twain, which at the
most, in a few short years, will be wholly taken away!&nbsp; Oh!
brethren, we can risk our eternal hopes when they seem
distant&mdash;we dare not, we could not, if we felt them
close!&nbsp; Behold, the judge is at the door!&nbsp; Watch, lest
it open and reveal Him!&nbsp; Behold the messenger is coming; be
ready, for He may be sent to summon you to the presence of the
<span class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment!</p>
<p>But we have not yet the full answer to our text.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> is everywhere.&nbsp; He fills heaven and
earth with His presence.&nbsp; And He is the same everywhere, and
at all times; the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; and so He
is the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment, exercising
judgment even in this life.&nbsp; <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>It cannot be otherwise.&nbsp; It
belongs to His very essence to love righteousness and hate
iniquity.&nbsp; When He wills, it is done; when He feels, He
acts; what He hates, He shrinks from&mdash;and if He shrinks, is
it not judgment?&nbsp; What He loves, He clings to&mdash;and is
not His presence favour, and support, and blessing?&nbsp;
Brethren, I have often exhorted you not to shut <span
class="smcap">God</span> out of this present world as if He
belonged only to the future.&nbsp; Live in the world to
Him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherever we live, we live unto the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Live in the world by
Him.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is at
hand.&nbsp; Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer
and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made unto
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And live in the
world, under Him: for &ldquo;The eyes of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> are over the righteous, and the face of
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is against them that do
evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, the <span class="smcap">God</span> of
Judgment is <i>here</i>.&nbsp; You know it was so in Old
Testament times.&nbsp; The deed of righteousness then brought its
immediate reward; the deed of sin its punishment.&nbsp; Murmur or
disregard drove away the pillar of fire, repentance and prayer
brought it back.&nbsp; You think it otherwise now perhaps, but
&ldquo;I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I change
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; The children of Israel were carnal babes, <span
class="smcap">God</span> therefore showed Himself to their
natural eye.&nbsp; <i>We</i> are men in <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and the vision, <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>therefore, is
to our faith.&nbsp; It was with perishable toys that <i>they</i>
were pleased: He, therefore, rewarded or punished them with
temporal things.&nbsp; It is differently, <i>in a measure</i>,
that He deals with us; but not altogether differently.&nbsp; It
is a mistake to suppose that <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> favour was always testified to
the Jews by prosperity, His displeasure by adversity.&nbsp; Think
of Abraham, of Job, of Moses, of Joseph, of the ungodly in great
prosperity, and you will see the mistake.&nbsp; Temporal
circumstances were more often, then, the tokens of spiritual, but
the spiritual has always been the reality; and in comparison with
it, the token, not always afforded, is immaterial.&nbsp; Oh! do
not suppose that when the Man <span class="smcap">Christ
Jesus</span> came on earth as the messenger of grace, the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Providence departed.&nbsp; More real
and constant is His presence now, and more invariable His
action.&nbsp; In respect of our service of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> and candidateship for heaven, there
is a sense in which He leaves us unjudged till the end.&nbsp;
But, in another sense, as He must, from His very nature, be
always judging, so are we Christians the special objects of His
judgment.&nbsp; No winking at <i>our</i> ignorance, no
long-suffering with <i>our</i> sin.&nbsp; Enlightened and
enabled, we are responsible, and immediately made to answer, for
all that is wrong; <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>and, specially endeared to Him, we are immediately
rewarded for all that He approves.&nbsp; And this judgment is
visible, if we will but look for it even in our temporal
circumstances.&nbsp; I do not say that the righteous are always
what the world calls prosperous, and the wicked always what the
world calls unfortunate, though that is not seldom the case, much
more often than, in our rash judgment, we suppose; besides, any
kinds of temporal circumstances may be made, and often are made,
the sources of temporal reward or punishment; but temporal things
are not the best or the worst that <span class="smcap">God</span>
can give.&nbsp; They are chiefly used by Him as means; and could
I describe to you the blessings which poverty and bereavement and
disappointment and affliction have produced, and the curses which
have accompanied riches and success, and immunity from loss and
trial, you would see what effectual means they are, and would
readily exclaim, &ldquo;<i>Here</i> is the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment!&rdquo;&nbsp; But there is a
better and a worse judgment.&nbsp; You know how <span
class="smcap">God</span> hardened Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, because
it was not softened; how He made Saul&rsquo;s perversity his
punishment; how He stiffened Jeroboam&rsquo;s arm that he could
not draw it in from the deed of sin; what a sinful security He
brought upon David for transgression; how Abraham <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>grew rich by
forsaking his home; how Job resigned much and therefore received
more; how Joseph, fleeing from Potiphar&rsquo;s wife, was made to
prosper in all he did.&nbsp; These things are types of great
realities&mdash;specimens of constant judgments.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> stands over every man to watch what he
does, and as soon as it is done, He judges and rewards it.&nbsp;
Ah! let the wicked tremble at this, and let the righteous rejoice
at it.&nbsp; A harassed or a calmed conscience may or may not be
an accompaniment of the judgment, but a judgment there will
surely be.&nbsp; Do you want an illustration?&nbsp; Why, then,
should the man who commits a trivial sin to-day fall into a
greater sin to-morrow?&nbsp; Why should a little resistance
qualify for a great one?&nbsp; You say it is natural.&nbsp; If
you mean by that that is <i>spiritual</i>, that it is the acting
influence of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> providence, I
agree with you; but not otherwise.&nbsp; Man is not his own
destroyer, nor his own saviour.&nbsp; It no more follows
naturally that a man should fall into a great sin after a little
one, or should conquer a strong temptation after overcoming a
weak one, than that he should soil his garments or his flesh much
to-day, because he soiled them a little yesterday, or that he
should float in a flood because he has turned aside from a
pool!&nbsp; It is a judgment that makes him sin again, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>and a
judgment that enables him to resist again.&nbsp; In the one case,
it is the angry withdrawal of grace, and the giving up to a
reprobate mind, and the delivery to Satan; in the other it is the
approving increase of grace, and the sending of angels to keep
off the fiends.&nbsp; <i>Where is the</i> <span
class="smcap">God</span> <i>of Judgment</i>!&nbsp; Where,
brethren, is He not, and when not acting?&nbsp; This world is the
throne of judgment.&nbsp; Every moment is the trial time.&nbsp;
Every act, every word, every thought, brings down upon it, on the
instant, the sentence and the execution of the sentence!&nbsp;
Think of this and act upon it.&nbsp; The eyes of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> are over the righteous.&nbsp; The face
of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is against them that do
evil.&nbsp; Strive, then, each action to approve to His
all-seeing eye.&nbsp; Know that it is always Advent; that the
books are always open, and the judgment always set, and the
sentence ever ready, &ldquo;Blessed&mdash;or Cursed,&rdquo; and
angels and demons looking out and waiting for the signal of
approach.&nbsp; The Last Judgment is the climax of the Death
Judgment, the Death Judgment of the Life Judgment.&nbsp; Gain
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> approval here, and keep it
here, and you shall not lose it hereafter.&nbsp; Forfeit it here,
and obtain it not again here, and you can never have it.&nbsp;
There is no condemnation for them that are in <span
class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>.&nbsp; The rest are already
condemned; <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>though the <span class="smcap">God</span> of Judgment
gives them yet the chance&mdash;(oh! let them not trifle with
it!)&mdash;that if they will appeal quickly, a fresh trial may be
granted; and if they have made <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
their Advocate, the former sentence shall be reversed, and they,
too, shall be blessed!</p>
<h2><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>SERMON
III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WORLDLING REPROVED.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
James</span>, <span class="smcap">iv</span>., 13, 14, 15.</p>
<p><i>Go to now</i>, <i>ye that say</i>, <i>To-day or to-morrow
we will go into such a city</i>, <i>and continue there a
year</i>, <i>and buy and sell</i>, <i>and get gain</i>:
<i>Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow</i>.&nbsp;
<i>For what is your life</i>?&nbsp; <i>It is even a vapour</i>,
<i>that appeareth for a little time</i>, <i>and then vanisheth
away</i>.&nbsp; <i>For that ye ought to say</i>, <i>If the</i>
Lord <i>will</i>, <i>we shall live</i>, <i>and do this</i>, <i>or
that</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Go to</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
the language of rebuke, of remonstrance, and yet of
exhortation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, come, what are you doing? cease
from it, for it is wrong.&nbsp; Come, let us reason together, ye
that are forming worldly schemes, and laying out plans and works
for the future, counting not only on <i>some</i> continuance, but
even on a definite time of your own marking out, &lsquo;We will
continue there a year.&rsquo;&nbsp; Come, I say, be wise;
consider what your life is, how brief, how fleeting, how easily
taken away&mdash;how <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>uncertain of continuance&mdash;and
rule and consecrate every part of it, every work, every
prospective thought, with the limitation, &lsquo;If the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> will.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus is the worldling reproved and exhorted&mdash;the man who
is so foolish as to reckon surely upon what he knows is very
uncertain, who is so sinful as to forget the providence of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, or at least not to submit himself to
it.&nbsp; And, further on he is plainly told that this reckless
confidence is sin:&mdash;&ldquo;Therefore to him that knoweth to
do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observe here, my brethren&mdash;and you will thereby see how
directly this text is addressed, not to very gross and carnal
offenders, but even to such as ourselves&mdash;that the Apostle
does not cry out against the going into the city and proposing to
buy and sell and get gain there, or even against the fixing of a
particular period of sojourn; but against the doing of all this
<i>without reference and submission to</i>, <i>without dependence
upon the will and providence of</i> <span
class="smcap">God</span>; without remembrance that there is no
certainty of life, and power, and opportunity.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is our life&rdquo; &ldquo;If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
will?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">God</span> does not forbid, rather He
requires us to engage in worldly occupations.&nbsp; He has sent
us into the world in need of food and raiment, which <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the majority
of us can only get by working for them, and has endowed us with
faculties and powers which have their legitimate exercise in
worldly pursuits.&nbsp; There can be no question that by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> appointment man is to labour and
trade, or employ himself in some way in worldly things, for
sustenance and for exercise of many of his powers.&nbsp; And if
this is so, then neither can there be any question, that it must
be lawful to think in some way of the morrow, to provide what we
shall need in it, to consider and plan for our employment and
gain in it.&nbsp; It would be quite impossible to carry on many
callings&mdash;more especially those which have distinctly the
approval of <span class="smcap">God</span>, as husbandry, for
instance&mdash;if we might not forecast, anticipate, provide,
propose, and plan.&nbsp; And if all this may be done, then we may
and must mark out particular works and places, and specific
periods of time, wherein to perform what we propose.&nbsp; If a
husbandman may not think of the harvest, how shall he do the
duties of the seed time?&nbsp; If the merchant may not fix on a
mart nor make arrangements for sojourning there till he has
disposed of his goods, nor count the number of days which the
ship will require for transporting them, then how shall he know
what wares to purchase? how shall he persuade himself to <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>have anything
to do with merchandise?&nbsp; Surely, he must take for
granted&mdash;or at least he must act as if he took for
granted&mdash;some certainty of time and opportunity, and so he
must in one sense presume upon the future.&nbsp; Still, brethren,
the very illustrations I have chosen tell against counting on
actual certainty.&nbsp; The husbandman ploughs in hope and sows
in hope; but knows all the time that the fowls of the air may rob
him of his crop, that the needful rain or sun may be withholden
from it, that the worm, and the mildew, and the blast may destroy
it.&nbsp; The merchant freights his vessel with full
knowledge&mdash;(not always without fear)&mdash;that fire or
storm may cause it to be lost in the sea, or that if it reaches
the place of sale, there may then be no demand for it.&nbsp; Each
is obliged to admit contingencies; to prepare and act as if all
power and all time and circumstances were in his own hands, while
he knows and feels that it is far otherwise; that much may be
uncontrollably against him; that he may be disappointed of all
his hope.&nbsp; Nor does he omit altogether to provide for the
contingency.&nbsp; He asks, &ldquo;What if I should be
disappointed, if my plans should fail, if the time should be
prolonged or shortened against my expectation?&nbsp; What is to
be done with the gain, if anything happens to me?&rdquo;&nbsp; So
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>he insures
his vessel, and gives directions whither to carry, or what to do
with his merchandise if aught should render it unsaleable at the
proposed mart, and he makes his will!&nbsp; Wisely he takes into
account what he calls &ldquo;chance,&rdquo; and therefore sobers
his expectations and rules his plans by the consideration of what
may happen to frustrate them!&nbsp; A like
consideration&mdash;not of &ldquo;chance,&rdquo; for he does not
believe in chance, but of the possible unexpected operations of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> providence&mdash;is to
sanctify the Christian&rsquo;s plans and appointments, and to
prevent him from becoming a worldling.&nbsp; He may think and
say, what he will do on the morrow; he may set out on a long
journey, or propose to himself a week, a month&rsquo;s, a
year&rsquo;s, a ten years&rsquo; sojourn in some distant city; he
may make ample and long preparations for buying and selling, and
getting gain; he may pull down his barns (if they are not large
enough) and build greater; he may entertain some thoughts of
possibly enjoying, after years of toil and care, an old age of
ease and happiness, and so may make provision for that
happiness.&nbsp; He need not, and should not, be ever saying to
himself, &ldquo;It is of no use my undertaking this business, I
may not live to carry it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I were sure
of life, I would remove this and alter that, but let it be now,
it must do <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>for my poor uncertain days.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The world
would stand still, if men were to act, or refuse to act, upon
such arguments as these, arguments not suggested by God.)&nbsp;
No, brethren, whatever your calling, follow it honestly and
heartily; whatever your possessions, use them, and use them so as
to get the most legitimate good out of them, and do not despise
the opportunities and the goods which <span
class="smcap">God</span> has given you.&nbsp; But consider when
you propose to yourselves anything which draws by anticipation on
the future, consider, I say, &ldquo;What is my life?&nbsp; It is
even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth
away,&rdquo; and qualify your scheme by saying to yourselves,
&ldquo;If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will, I should live
and do this or that.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes! and provide, as far as you
can, <i>lest the</i> <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>should
not will</i>.&nbsp; And here, brethren, we have suggested to us
another reason for admitting an &ldquo;if&rdquo; into our
counsels, and for allowing it to have its say, and for heeding
well what it suggests.&nbsp; The Christian is allowed, and even
required to follow a worldly calling, but still he has a higher
calling, which he must not neglect, which he must most
regard.&nbsp; Life was not given him only that he might eat and
drink, and take his pleasure, and grow rich, and build palaces,
and be filled with knowledge, and perfected in
accomplishments.&nbsp; <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>These are but the lower employments
of life, or its intermittent pastimes.&nbsp; Its business is
religion&mdash;the laying hold on salvation, and following the
holy service to which we are bound, wherein we are apprentices
and probationers for eternal glory, and whereby we are allowed
and enabled to lay up treasure in heaven&mdash;the dedication of
ourselves to <span class="smcap">Christ</span> our Saviour, to
live under His rule, and by His grace; to set forth His glory in
all we do; to become qualified by unlearning and renouncing what
is amiss, and acquiring new tastes, and inclinations, and powers,
and fashioning ourselves after His glorious image for the state
to which He will call us when this life is over.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will I should live and do
this or that.&rdquo;&nbsp; How does such a suggestion break in
upon and check the presuming worldliness of the called of <span
class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp; &ldquo;Here am I,&rdquo; it makes
him exclaim, &ldquo;actually laying myself out for the engrossing
and long-continued pursuit of worldly ends.&nbsp; Yet <span
class="smcap">God</span> may cut short my life in the midst of
it, and if He does, without giving me time to resume my higher
calling, to repair what is out of order, to fill up what is
wanting, to make my peace with Him, to become fit for
death&mdash;oh, to what in that case will my folly and my sin
bring me!&nbsp; How shall I stand before Him at His awful
Advent?&nbsp; <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>What account shall I render of my neglected
stewardship?&nbsp; What will justify my presumption in His
delay?&nbsp; What excuse my want of the wedding garment?&nbsp;
Surely He will deal with me as with one who knew his
Master&rsquo;s will, yet did it not; who refused the glory which
he was created, and redeemed, and sanctified to render; who has
preferred Mammon to <span class="smcap">God</span>, earth to
heaven; who has contracted the worldliness from which <span
class="smcap">God</span> shrinks, and despised the holiness which
alone He will accept!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is an awakening, a
sobering, a solemn suggestion.&nbsp; It reveals to him the
anomaly, the folly, the sin, the peril of his condition, whatever
the kind of worldliness which engrosses him.&nbsp; He a servant
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, a votary of religion, a
worker for eternity, an heir of glory, forgetting his calling,
neglecting his best hopes and interests, perverting his time and
powers, and opportunities from their highest and most necessary
use, to gratify self with childish pleasures, to heap up gold, to
make to himself a name among the pigmies of the earth; to become
admired or stared at for his appearance or accomplishments; to
excel in knowledge of languages, or sciences, or history, or for
any other earthly end; when not only what he seeks must soon be
yielded up (even if he succeeds in getting it), but <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>also through
the seeking he must neglect all that <span
class="smcap">God</span> requires of him, and forfeit all that
<span class="smcap">God</span> offers!&nbsp; Oh, how silly, how
sinful, how awfully hazardous the course he is pursuing!</p>
<p>What, then?&nbsp; Shall he abandon it all in terror?&nbsp;
Shall he hate the world and flee from it?&nbsp; Shall he become a
hermit, refusing to receive good, and to do good in his
generation?&nbsp; Shall he give up his earthly calling, foregoing
the temporal advantages which are held out to him; not exercising
the powers which are entrusted to him; supposing that the <span
class="smcap">God</span> who put him into this world, and
qualified him to fill a place in it, and stimulated him by
pressing necessities, or by indwelling desires to seek profit or
pleasure, nevertheless meant him to have nothing to do with the
world; that because presently he is to die, now he ought not to
live; but to drag a sad, inactive, solitary, impatient
existence.&nbsp; Surely not!&nbsp; His place now is in the world,
his work is in the world; he refuses <span
class="smcap">God</span> service in not exercising his worldly
calling; he gives up the means of probation, and the
opportunities of development and improvement in the highest
powers and best graces, and disqualifies himself for heaven, if
he fulfils not his destiny on earth.&nbsp; Let him abide in his
calling; let him discharge its obligations; let him pursue its
advantages, <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>and cull its pleasures, and perform all its bidding; but
throughout all, let him remember, and act upon the remembrance
that he is not a mere worldling; and to keep him from being
absorbed in the world, or grovelling in its pursuits, to quicken
him in concern for higher responsibilities and privileges, to
impress upon him that all that is of the world is temporary and
fleeting, that the world is passing away from him, and he from
it, let him reflect frequently and seriously, &ldquo;What is my
life?&nbsp; It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
time, and then vanisheth away;&rdquo; and so let him temper the
lower life (and raise himself above it), by piously resolving
that its present occupations, its plans and hopes shall all be
subject to the condition, &ldquo;If the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> will I should live, and do this or
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That we all want to be influenced by such thoughts is too
evident to need proof.&nbsp; The very best of us are wont
practically to regard this earth as our abiding home, or the only
stage upon which we shall ever act a part, and earthly pursuits
and pleasures as the only aims and rewards of our being.&nbsp; We
may write &ldquo;D. V.,&rdquo; or say, &ldquo;If the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> will,&rdquo; after every engagement,
every proposed scheme.&nbsp; We may make our wills <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and set our
houses in order, and purchase a burial place, and carry about a
shroud, and yet forget that we have to die.&nbsp; Grey hairs, or
enfeebled frames, and the perceptible growth within us of the
seeds of mortal disease, and sick beds, and sudden deaths around
us, may cause us momentary misgivings, may make us perhaps
permanently a little uneasy: but still we live on, as though
there were no end of life; we put off preparation for death, and
for another state after death, as though we could not die till we
chose to do so.&nbsp; Not for want of knowledge, of constant
testimonies and reminders of the contrary are we thus confident
(for we all know that our life is but a vapour which the heat may
presently dispel, or the wind of the next moment cause to
vanish), but because we do not feel ourselves to be so entirely
in the hands of an Omnipotent and mysteriously exercised
Providence, as to need to be constantly depending upon it, and
asking of it, &ldquo;If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
will;&rdquo; and so presenting to ourselves, in all its force,
the consideration that perhaps &ldquo;The <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> may <i>not</i> will.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
speak to men, and women, and children, full of present
occupations and future plans.&nbsp; I bid you consider your
occupations and review your plans.&nbsp; Do you imagine that the
first may be at any moment interrupted, <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>and the last
never begun to be carried out?&nbsp; Some of you are almost
exclusively pleasure seekers; others, careless creatures of the
present; others intent upon business, or profit, upon obtaining
power, or knowledge, or fame; either reaping a worldly harvest
now, or sowing for a future worldly harvest.&nbsp; Others are
divided in care and desire between this life and the next.&nbsp;
Others are in theory, and in much practice, living above this
world, using it but not abusing it, in it but not of it.&nbsp;
Put the question to yourselves, all and each of you.&nbsp; Do you
feel your life to be such a vapour, that it is in momentary risk
of vanishing away; that only if the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> will, will it appear a little time;
that possibly He may not will?&nbsp; You would say,
&ldquo;yes,&rdquo; doubtless, if you were forced to answer aloud,
as you sit in church, interrogated by the messenger of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> out of the Bible, just as to a
question out of the Church Catechism, you would give an answer
out of the Church Catechism.&nbsp; But do you <i>feel</i>
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;?&nbsp; Is it your sure and strong
conviction?&nbsp; Do your lives say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;?&nbsp; I
shall not be unjust to you, if I say that I stand in doubt of
many of you; that, alas! I have no doubt of some; that your
hearts do not thus respond; that your lives give a manifest
contradiction.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>Brethren, I am not here to accuse, but to admonish and
help.&nbsp; Let me suggest, then, why you fail to realise such a
palpable truth.&nbsp; It is, first, because you have an idea that
the Advent is far off; and, secondly, because, as I have reminded
you in so many ways lately, you shut <span
class="smcap">God</span> too much out of this present
world.&nbsp; The first disciples, as you may see from St.
Paul&rsquo;s and St. Peter&rsquo;s Epistles, were filled with the
conviction that the Advent was very near, that the next moment
might reveal it.&nbsp; This did not take them out of the world,
for they believed that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> would
come to them in the world.&nbsp; Neither did it make them forsake
their earthly calling, for they knew that it was in that calling
that they were to serve <span class="smcap">God</span>, and to
prepare for His coming.&nbsp; But it caused them always to have
regard to the end, and it sanctified every pursuit and plan with
the thought, &ldquo;The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> may
come,&rdquo; and so constantly suggested the proviso, &ldquo;If
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have no
such conviction of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
nearness, and therefore have little reference to it, and are
faintly impressed with it.&nbsp; We argue, the Judgment has
tarried so many years, it may therefore tarry many more.&nbsp;
Death has so long spared us, he will not come to us yet.&nbsp; We
shall have time to finish our present <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>occupations, we can enter upon and
execute many fresh plans.&nbsp; We need not raise a doubt,
&ldquo;If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, secondly, we shut <span class="smcap">God</span> out of
this present world.&nbsp; We forget that He is ever with us; that
He is constantly exercising His providence over us; that He is
not ignorant, or indifferent, much less distant, when we propose
and proceed to execute; that it is by His exercised permission,
by His actual letting us go in anger, that we fall into sin; by
His inclining, and helping, and carrying us, that we think, and
attempt, and perform what is good; that thus watching and caring
for us, and surrounding us, He is at once the Witness, the Judge,
the Rewarder of our every thought and way; that consequently,
when He has tried us enough, or when we have long wearied Him, He
is at hand to decide about us, and, deciding, to execute the
decision.&nbsp; His forbearance and interference, the length of
the probation, the numbers and kinds of trial, are different in
different cases.&nbsp; He knows what is right and sufficient for
each, and He applies it, and then He says, &ldquo;It is
enough.&nbsp; Thy righteousness is as length of days.&nbsp; Well
done, good and faithful servant;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;It is of no
use that thou shouldst be stricken any more.&nbsp; Thou wilt
revolt more and more.&nbsp; The <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>whole head is sick, and the whole
heart faint.&nbsp; Depart from me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And in either
case the vapour is dispelled&mdash;it vanisheth away.</p>
<p>O for the full perception and realisation of this truth; that
we are in the hands of a watching, proving, waiting, judging,
visiting <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It would be hard
then to do or propose anything, without immediately adding,
&ldquo;If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two concluding thoughts suggest themselves.</p>
<p>First, that life is of such different duration in different
cases, because we have individual capabilities and
responsibilities, and some by many trials and length of days are
proved, others quickly and easily made perfect, or wholly
hardened; and because a discerning, ruling <span
class="smcap">God</span> is ever at hand to close the trial at
the fit moment.</p>
<p>Secondly, that we are individually kept uncertain of the
duration of our life, to counteract the sad proneness which
belongs to us, of putting off eternal interests, and following
our own ways to the uttermost; to give to every moment, and every
act of life, such vital importance, that we may fear to squander
or pervert it; to keep us ever mindful of our latter end, and
always intent upon doing the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> work, and preparing ourselves
for heaven; that the <span class="smcap">God</span> at hand may
never be slighted, and the world be always so loosely held, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>that we may
easily and readily let go of it whenever the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go
into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell,
and get gain: Whereas ye know not what shall be on the
morrow.&nbsp; For what is your life?&nbsp; It is even a vapour,
that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.&nbsp;
For that ye ought to say, If the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
will, we shall live, and do this, or that.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE UNKNOWN GOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Acts</span>, <span class="smcap">xvii</span>., 22,
23.</p>
<p><i>Ye men of Athens</i>, <i>I perceive that in all things ye
are too superstitious</i>.&nbsp; <i>For as I passed by</i>,
<i>and beheld your devotions</i>, <i>I found an altar with this
inscription</i>, <span class="smcap">To the Unknown
God</span>.&nbsp; <i>Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship</i>,
<i>Him declare I unto you</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> city of Athens was wholly given
to idolatry.&nbsp; It was crowded with altars, dedicated to the
supposed superior deities, to deified men, to abstract virtues,
Love, Truth, Mercy, and the like.&nbsp; Whatever new god was
described and recommended to them was immediately recognised, and
thenceforth worshipped; and, besides, the Athenians&rsquo; love
of something new, led them to search out for and invent gods for
themselves.&nbsp; Hence it came to pass, that there were more
idols in that one city than in all the rest of Greece: so that
Satirist did not much exaggerate when he said that in Athens you
might more <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>easily find a god than a man.&nbsp; It belongs not to
our present purpose to consider how this arose; to contemplate
the strange coexistence of so much superstition and so much
cultivation of intellect, or to strive to enter into the feelings
which animated Paul, when his spirit was stirred within him at
the sight of the city wholly given to idolatry.&nbsp; We pass on
to the time when the Apostle stood on Mars&rsquo;s hill, in sight
of many heathen altars, surrounded by Epicureans and Stoics and
disciples of many other schools of philosophy, some striving to
silence him, others intent upon hearing something new from
him&mdash;to meet the contentious gainsayings of the one, to
enlist the curiosity of the other; to make use of their various
dispositions, of all that he saw and heard, in promoting the
glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and, if it might be, in
leading them to salvation.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that some of these news-seeking
Athenians inconsistently enough contended with him, because he
taught what was novel; while others, on that very account, were
favourable to him, hoping that he would set forth some strange
gods&mdash;some additional objects of worship to whom they might
erect altars.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye men of Athens,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I perceive from actual observation that you, more than
other people, <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>have great regard for religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the
right meaning of the words translated: &ldquo;In all things ye
are too superstitious.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not likely that the
Apostle would have commenced a speech intended to conciliate and
enlighten them, with words that would at once affront them, and
make them deaf to all else he had to say.&nbsp; Besides, it is
clear from what follows, that he is not directly calling upon
them to abandon what was false, but to understand and accept
rightly a truth which they held in ignorance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I say
nothing to you now upon the many gods whom you worship <i>by
name</i>, but, pointing to an altar inscribed to the Unknown
<span class="smcap">God</span> (it was probably in sight) I
answer those who contend with me for speaking about the unknown,
and gratify those who want to hear something new, by taking that
altar as my text, and preaching to you about &lsquo;the Unknown
<span class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;&mdash;about no new god, for
He is already the object of your worship; but still about one of
whom much that is new to you may be said.&nbsp; Give ear to me,
ye that are so full of reverence for the gods, while I describe
to you an object indeed of your present reverence, but one of
whose nature and operations and demands upon you, you know
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Respecting the existence of such an altar, we <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>are told that
the Athenians through the very excess of their idolatry (which
led them to look for gods in every place and circumstance, and to
ascribe every event, good or ill, to the influence of some deity)
had on more than one occasion, when an unusually severe
pestilence had visited them, which they could not connect with
any of their known gods, conjectured that it must be the doing of
some god whom they did not propitiate with sacrifices, and,
failing to find out who it was, and yet fearing to neglect his
worship, had caused altars <i>without names</i> to be erected,
and offerings to be made to the nameless being; and that in
course of time these altars came to be described, and to bear a
corresponding inscription, as severally the altars of an
&ldquo;unknown god.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no reason to suppose
that they meant to exalt that god above the others, that they had
any clearly defined ideas of the general operations of one
unknown Being, much less that they meant under that title to
worship the <span class="smcap">God</span> of the Jews; but with
a kind of natural instinct, a very vague feeling that something
beyond and above what they knew, existed, they had stumbled, as
it were, in the dark, upon a real truth, which was now to be
revealed to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whom therefore ye ignorantly
worship&mdash;Whom you are right in worshipping, <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>but of Whose
proper worship you know nothing, Him declare I, and reveal unto
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; You know how St. Paul went on, meeting without
mentioning the errors of the various sects of philosophers, that
there was indeed a <span class="smcap">God</span> who made the
world, and all things therein; that He was not a mere idol of
wood and stone (&ldquo;dwelling not in temples made with
hands&rdquo;), that He had no such passions, and no such needs as
they ascribed to Jove and Mars and their deified men
(&ldquo;Neither is worshipped with men&rsquo;s hands as though He
needed anything&rdquo;), that He was not a sentiment&mdash;an
ideal thing&mdash;a being bound by fate&mdash;an indifferent
spectator of men&rsquo;s ways.&nbsp; &ldquo;He giveth to all life
and breath and all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In Him we live and
move and have our being.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath appointed a
day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by the
man whom He hath chosen;&rdquo; to whom He has borne such signal
testimony in raising Him from the dead; in whose name, and at
whose command, I come to tell you of the resurrection from the
dead, and to call you out of the ignorance which <span
class="smcap">God</span> will no longer wink at, and to urge upon
you repentance and preparation for judgment.&nbsp; So he spoke of
the unknown <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Some mocked,
and refused to understand; some were in doubt <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and
difficulty, and wished to hear more; others began to know Him who
had hitherto been unknown, and clave unto the Apostle, and
believed.&nbsp; And shortly after Paul departed from Athens,
never, as far as we know, to visit again!</p>
<p>It would be interesting to consider the strange rise and
spread of ignorance which in course of time made the <span
class="smcap">God</span>, Who had been seen and heard and walked
with in Eden, and had never left Himself without witness, wholly
unknown to the creatures of His hand, and the objects of His
providential care; to contemplate the idolatry of ignorant
heathen man, not seeing <span class="smcap">God</span> in all His
works, not able to find Him even when looking for Him and
desiring to worship Him, believing in every god but the true One,
sometimes even offering sacrifices to devils; to discuss, too,
how it is the world by wisdom knows not, and never has known
<span class="smcap">God</span>, that intellect cannot search Him
out, that intellect has even blinded many to whom the unknown
<span class="smcap">God</span> was plainly exhibited; to ask how
much of this is natural, how much unnatural, how much
judicial&mdash;the punishment of pride, the reward of loving
darkness rather than light, because of evil deeds.&nbsp; But
interesting as would be the consideration of &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> unknown in the world,&rdquo; there is a
more important theme suggested <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>by the text for us to dwell on,
namely, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> unknown in the
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There standeth one among you Whom ye
know not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me speak to you on this, brethren.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the state and disposition of the people whom
the clergyman has to deal with in his various daily ministrations
and his intercourse with the world, once a week, at least, he
addresses an assembly in some sense given to religion.&nbsp; As
he stands in the pulpit on the Lord&rsquo;s Day he may adopt
almost the words of St. Paul on the Areopagus: &ldquo;I perceive
that you (and such as you) are more than the rest of mankind
<span class="smcap">God</span>-fearing, taking an interest in
religion, listening to its teaching, partaking of its ordinances,
supplicating, praising, serving <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may, indeed, occasionally be that some present themselves
to see if there is anything in the church for them to object to,
or ridicule; that others have come in conformity to the fashion,
to hear something new, to see and be seen; to make a show of
respectability, to wile away an idle time; and that many others,
though proposing to themselves the observance of a religious
duty, are so formal, so listless, so unreal, that it cannot be
said of them that they are &ldquo;given to religion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nevertheless, I repeat that the clergyman, as he <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>stands in the
pulpit, has before him the best, <i>i.e.</i>, the most religious
of mankind; not mockers, and revilers, and persecutors; not
gainsayers, and despisers, and forgetters; but real
worshippers&mdash;more or less reverential and earnest, more or
less enlightened&mdash;of the true <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; But has he not in these same
persons (as St. Paul had in the Athenians) many worshippers of an
unknown <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; May he not venture
to say to almost all, &ldquo;Whom ye ignorantly worship, Him
declare I unto you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Christian worshippers, my
brethren, often have many idols, who share almost equally with
<span class="smcap">God</span> their interest and affections and
service.&nbsp; They have, many of them, their &ldquo;ism,&rdquo;
their Paul, their Cephas, or Apollos, their favourite dogma,
their preferences and prejudices for some particular rites, and
ceremonies, and modes of worship.&nbsp; In church, and out of
church, their religion consists largely in giving heed to these
things: <span class="smcap">God</span> is in their thoughts, but
not in all their thoughts, or not the chief, the engrossing
object of their thoughts; He is one of many objects.&nbsp; You
find this out if you listen to their remarks after service.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Such a chant went well or badly; the preacher&rsquo;s
manner was pleasing, or the contrary; his language very ornate,
or very bald; the theme one they like, or one they do not like;
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>the rubric
strictly observed, or strangely disregarded;&rdquo; and so
on.&nbsp; Of course, as all these things are means to an end, and
as the end is gained, or not gained, by their suitableness, or
the opposite, it is lawful and right to give them some
consideration: but I put it to you, brethren, whether they are
not too often regarded as themselves the end; as though, provided
they were satisfactory, there was nothing more wanting; as though
they were rightly as much the objects of interest as the <span
class="smcap">God</span> in Whose service they are used, or,
rather, as though regarding them were regarding <span
class="smcap">God</span>!</p>
<p>O brethren, we are too attentive to the system&mdash;too
regardless of the Centre!&nbsp; We want to know&mdash;(to feel, I
mean, for the Christian&rsquo;s knowledge is of the
heart)&mdash;that <span class="smcap">God</span> is above
all&mdash;that where other objects have anything like an equal
share of attention, where they hide Him from us in His pure
essence and direct influence, there He is ignorantly
worshipped&mdash;that He is a Spirit, not a chant, a voice, a
figure of speech, a rubric, a turning east or west.&nbsp; Through
these we may reach Him; many of them are steps and accessories to
worship; but if in these we rest, then we set them up as idols,
side by side with Him, and prove that to us He is but as the
unknown god of the Athenians.</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>See,
dear brethren, I beseech you, if aught of this old error clings
to you, and pray <span class="smcap">God</span> to clear you from
it, and resolve henceforth to strive to keep clear.&nbsp; Treat
means as means&mdash;value them; be glad that they are becomingly
afforded you, and rejoice if they help you; but do not let the
best of them beguile you, nor the worst of them hinder you, from
finding and worshipping <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself;
from going away filled with thoughts of Him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
prayed to <span class="smcap">God</span>; I praised Him; I held
communion with Him; I heard the things of <span
class="smcap">God</span> from His messenger, and have now to go
and live by what I have done, and received, and
heard.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are the thoughts to take away from
church with you, and to prove to you that you wisely worship the
known <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>I have dwelt much on this part of the subject, because of the
general forgetfulness of it; a forgetfulness which prevents many
from rendering acceptable service to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and from obtaining the full help and
comfort which religion affords to all who rightly use it.</p>
<p>But there are many other kinds of ignorant worship.&nbsp; It
is possible to cast down all idols, and worship <span
class="smcap">God</span> alone, and yet err.&nbsp; The so-called
spiritualist does this: the man who supposes that addressing
himself directly to <span class="smcap">God</span>, is <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>sufficient,
without the use of appointed forms and ordinances; who attaches
no importance to baptism and holy communion; who thinks that no
grace accompanies their use, or that he can have the grace
without the sign; who says that praying at home is a good
substitute for congregational worship; who boasts that he can
read a sermon for himself, and a better one than he can hear in
church; or that the Bible is sufficiently clear to him without an
interpreter.</p>
<p>Such an one ignorantly worships an unknown <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; He dictates, instead of obeying;
he chooses, instead of submitting to what is appointed for him;
he puts reason in the place of faith; he refuses to walk in <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> way of salvation; he disputes
the Divine wisdom in requiring him to be baptised, and to partake
of the Cup and Bread of Blessing; in warning not to forsake the
assembling of ourselves together; in asking, &ldquo;How shall
they hear without a preacher?&rdquo; in appointing a standing
ministry; he rebels against <span class="smcap">God</span>, when
he disregards these ordinances; he makes <span
class="smcap">God</span> a liar when he presumes to deem them
unnecessary.&nbsp; Oh, he has great need that the <span
class="smcap">God</span> whom he ignorantly worships, should be
plainly declared unto him!</p>
<p>Again, that man ignorantly worships <span
class="smcap">God</span>, who <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>substitutes the forms for the life of
religion; who supposes that a sanctuary service atones for all
want of service elsewhere; who prays in church, but not in his
closet; who hears the Bible read or expounded, but does not
search it diligently for himself; who receives sacraments, but
does not foster, and use, and develop the sacramental grace,
which is entrusted to him as an awful talent to be increased and
accounted for; who balances the religion of Sunday against the
worldliness of the whole week; who every seventh day eases his
conscience of its sin, by sighing out the general confession, and
forthwith takes to himself the comfort of the declaration of
forgiveness, and then goes back to his old transgressions and
omissions, till the holy day comes round again.&nbsp; Of course
whoever does this, or any part of it deliberately, is grossly,
culpably ignorant of the <span class="smcap">God</span> whom he
professes to worship; but it is not of such that I speak
now.&nbsp; I have in mind professing Christians, persons who busy
themselves about religion, who are regular in their attendance on
means of grace, who never wilfully desecrate the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> day, who knowing that
unpardoned sin separates from <span class="smcap">God</span>, and
that without grace, life is unblessed, are anxious for pardon and
grace, and frequently seek them in <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> appointed ways; but yet, forget,
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>are not
impressed with the danger of a relapse, and the sin of
non-improvement, and so somehow or other, fall into a routine of
formal religion on Sunday, which is not in their thoughts, except
as a matter that belongs to next Sunday all through the
week.&nbsp; This is to worship ignorantly an unknown <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;a <span class="smcap">God</span>
Who does not accept intermittent worship, Who bestows pardon only
on repentance and amendment of life, Who gives grace for use,
Whose sacraments are meals to sustain life and strengthen for
service, Whose Sabbath is a holy rest to refresh for holy work,
in Whom we live, and move, and have our being, Whose glory is to
be our constant aim, His presence our perpetual joy.&nbsp; But
these, and many other ignorances&mdash;such as the disregard of
particular attributes, the picturing for oneself what <span
class="smcap">God</span> ought to be like, and so varying the
picture according to the fancy of him who draws it, instead of
searching how, and what manner of <span class="smcap">God</span>
He has declared Himself to be, and what worship is appointed, and
therefore acceptable&mdash;these, I say, are the faults of
individuals, or of certain classes only.&nbsp; Let me now speak
of an ignorance, a respect in which <span
class="smcap">God</span> is more or less unknown, which concerns
us all.&nbsp; And here, dear brethren, my object is not to
censure, to blame you for <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>what you have not, but pointing out
to you the <span class="smcap">God</span> whom Scripture reveals,
to help you to correct what is amiss, to fill up what is wanting
in your conceptions of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and so to
attain to the blessedness of knowing Him fully, and to discharge
the duty of worshipping Him in spirit and in truth.</p>
<p>Observe St. Paul, while acknowledging the religious reverence
of the Athenians, evidently deals with them as men who understood
not the truths, the objects, the blessings of religion; as those
who when they had built their altars, and celebrated their holy
days, and offered their sacrifices, thought they had fulfilled
all that religion required of them, and who expected to get
nothing by their religion, but exemption from certain grievous
pestilences, or help perhaps in war&mdash;mere occasional
miraculous manifestations of dreadful power&mdash;who had no
conceptions of sanctifying influence, of moral responsibility, of
rewards of righteousness.&nbsp; To them he declares <span
class="smcap">God</span> to be, One not far from them, One whom
they might find, in Whom they then lived and moved, and had their
being, Who henceforth would not wink at any ignorance, Who was at
present treating them, and regarding them with a view to a coming
judgment.&nbsp; Now we are better (thank <span
class="smcap">God</span>, who <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>maketh us to differ!) than these
Athenians; but still we want somewhat of the heart-knowledge
which Paul would have impressed on them.&nbsp; We want to be more
fully convinced that religion is not a pastime, but a business;
that not only duty, but interest, momentous interest, is involved
in it, especially that it is not a mere concern and preparation
and provision for the future, but a present substantial reality;
that <span class="smcap">God</span> is not the object of distant
worship; that His wrath and His mercy are, not rarely, but
constantly, being exercised here; that He is not a departed <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, Who has set us to do His work against
His return, and will take no account of us till some far off day;
that He has not left us unrewarded, unpunished, unhelped in the
present, not caring what we are, what we do, what we suffer, so
as when He comes back, we have either done what He appointed, or
have assumed the position of penitents for offence, and
supplicants of compassion.</p>
<p>Is it not matter of experience that we are not sufficiently
influenced by the hopes and fears of religion, that we do not
adequately reverence <span class="smcap">God</span>, or seek Him,
and rest on Him, because we suppose that He is afar off, and that
all that we have to expect from Him, will only begin to be
realised in the next world?&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span>,
as a present <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span><span class="smcap">God</span>, is too much unknown to
us.&nbsp; We do not feel that He is now about us; that His eye is
watching us, and His arm upraised over each of us at every moment
of our lives; that He is a guest actually in us, to be honoured
and waited on now.&nbsp; We do not know of His present closeness,
of His immediate rewards and punishments, His pleasure or
displeasure, His instant succour, or instant withdrawal from us,
according to what He sees in us.&nbsp; We do all, and bear all in
distant expectation, and therefore we do negligently, and bear
feebly and impatiently.&nbsp; Could we realise the perpetual
working, the instant retribution, the very touching of <span
class="smcap">God</span> now, it would be easy to regard and
serve Him, it would be all but impossible to neglect Him.&nbsp;
No man could prefer dross to gold, misery to bliss, death to
life, if they were both offered him at the same moment.&nbsp; No
one could hesitate whom to obey, whom to trust, whom to fear,
whom to love, if <span class="smcap">God</span> were seen on the
one side, and fellow man on the other.&nbsp; It is because <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and the things of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, are supposed to be far off, that we
first prefer the other, and then practically regard it as that
which alone has real existence.</p>
<p>Well, then, this is what we have to mend.&nbsp; I have been
urging the mending on these Sundays <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>in Advent, in striving to show you
that there is a <span class="smcap">God</span> present to
superintend, and provide, and care for you in this life, and in
every event and moment of this life; that there is an actual and
immediate judgment of every deed, good and evil, and that there
is a present business of religion, and a direct service of <span
class="smcap">God</span> to be now attended to.&nbsp; It is not
head-knowledge that you want, but heart-perception, and
realisation.&nbsp; You want to feel what you must know (because
the Bible has told you that <span class="smcap">God</span> is a
<span class="smcap">God</span> at hand, and not a <span
class="smcap">God</span> afar off); that godliness has the
promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to
come; that the irreligious is condemned already.&nbsp; No
expectation, no delay, no vision.&nbsp; All fulfilled, immediate,
and substantially real.&nbsp; You fancy, perhaps, that it cannot
be so.&nbsp; You urge that it is contrary to your experience; you
have served <span class="smcap">God</span>, and not been
rewarded; you have trusted in Him, and not been supported; you
have sinned against Him, and not been punished.&nbsp; Brethren,
believe me, you have not.&nbsp; &ldquo;Experience&rdquo; means
that which has been ascertained by trial.&nbsp; Make trial, and
all will be proved.&nbsp; Devote yourselves now to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, follow Him, give up for Him to-day, and
you shall be rewarded to-day.&nbsp; Sin against Him to-day, and
you shall be punished to-day.&nbsp; <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Invoke His aid to-day, and you shall
surely have it.&nbsp; Do not prescribe your own mode of
visitation.&nbsp; Be sure that He will use His, and watch for it,
and seek to know it, and then you will have an experience to
quote.&nbsp; I only repeat to you what He has said.&nbsp; When
you know Him, you will find that He is true.&nbsp; Then wait on
Him, acquaint yourselves with Him, serve Him in the present, and
look for Him in the present, and you will find Him in the
present.</p>

do till again He is seen in Heaven.&nbsp; But peace and joy are
not the greatest blessings.&nbsp; That which calms, that which

not proved to us, but are supported by reliable statement.&nbsp;
If you serve for wages, or sell goods on credit, or become surety
for another, or go out to seek a new home in a distant land, you
do it in faith.&nbsp; You cannot see into the heart, and be sure
of the honesty of your employer, your customer, your friend; but
what appears, from what you are told by others of him, you rely
on him.&nbsp; And so <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>again, you do not actually know that
there is such a land as you propose to seek, but you believe it,
because of all that travellers have said of it, of the goods you
have seen, the letters you have read, which are stated to have
come from it.&nbsp; Of course, as the testimony varies in its
credibility, this faith is of different degrees.&nbsp; You have
such faith in your well-tried friend, in his integrity and his
wisdom, that you know, you say, that he will not deceive you, and
that he cannot be deceived himself.&nbsp; Others, of whom you
know less, you believe more slowly.&nbsp; Some, you think, are
not qualified to give testimony; they have the thing second-hand,
or they were not competent to judge of what they saw, and heard,
and felt; or they are not truthful, and may wilfully
misrepresent: and even, in the best cases, faith is sometimes
misplaced.&nbsp; Therefore, your faith in human things, has
always, perhaps (and should have) a trace of doubt in
it&mdash;sometimes is weak, sometimes fails altogether.&nbsp; It
would be wrong and injurious to have equal faith in all; but, on
the other hand, to be always doubting, to refuse to believe
without seeing, would be misery, and folly, and mockery of
self.&nbsp; Divine faith is different: the accepting (that is) of
what is recommended to us by the testimony of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, by <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>well-proved miracles, by prophecies
since fulfilled, by any other of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> witnesses.&nbsp; This is
perfect.&nbsp; It admits of no doubts and qualifications.&nbsp;
It is as sure of what it believes, as if it handled, and heard,
and saw it: yea, surer, for its own judgment might be deceived;
but <span class="smcap">God</span> knows all things and judges
rightly, and <span class="smcap">God</span> cannot deceive.&nbsp;
Therefore, when <span class="smcap">God</span> reveals, we may
not question the plausibility of what is shown; we have no room
for doubt as to His opportunities of knowing, His truthfulness in
communicating what is narrated.&nbsp; All we may do, is to
ask&mdash;Has <span class="smcap">God</span> spoken, are these
things His testimony?&nbsp; And this we ought to do; for there is
no blessing pronounced by the text on the credulous, who take
everything as from <span class="smcap">God</span>, without
examination.&nbsp; Thomas surely would have erred, if, simply
because some one told him of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> resurrection, he had
straightway believed it.&nbsp; We are exhorted not to believe
every spirit, but to try the spirits whether they be of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; We have to examine miracles, to
see whether they are real or pretended, and prophecies, to see
that they were not written after the professed fulfilments, and
all revelations, lest they should be spurious.&nbsp; Failing to
do this, we might have followed Theudas, who came to nought, or
Joan of Arc: we might become Mohammedans <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>or
Mormonites.&nbsp; We have to guard against this; not to be
credulous; to be sure that it is <span class="smcap">God</span>
that speaks: but then, being sure, whatever He describes, however
incomprehensible or improbable, whatever He commands, no matter
how apparently unreasonable, whatever He promises, against
experience, against opinion, against hope, to accept all, and
rely on all, and lead the life of reliance.&nbsp; Yes, brethren,
this is the believing which alone is blessed; the believing which
leads to doing.&nbsp; Faith is the evidence by which we see
things naturally unseen; it is the substance, the very handled
reality, of things naturally only hoped for; and which, by its
revelations of beauty and bliss, by its sanctions and
persuasions, and by all that it shows us of the present, and
promises or threatens in the future, makes us fly to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and cling to Him, and depend on Him,
and live for Him, and look for Him.&nbsp; Less than
this&mdash;mere assent of the understanding, without
heart-embracing, and life-demonstrating, and exercising&mdash;is
not the belief that is blessed.&nbsp; Faith without works is
dead, being alone.&nbsp; If then, brethren, you would be
partakers of the blessedness promised in the text, you must have
fully received, and be acting upon the form of religion which
<span class="smcap">God</span> has given you.&nbsp; You must have
implicit <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>trust in Him for help and support and peace and
blessing.&nbsp; You must know that whatever He has described is
real, whatever He has promised or threatened will surely be
fulfilled, on the conditions He has laid down; and you must
testify and act upon your knowledge by a corresponding
life.&nbsp; I do not say that all this is demanded of you in
perfection; that the hope of blessing is gone, if you fail of
aught of it: but I do say that, if in anything you distrust <span
class="smcap">God</span>, if you question or demand further proof
of, or are indifferent to anything He has revealed, and
deliberately do not live by it, then you cannot claim the
benediction of the text.</p>
<p>But it occurs to you to ask, perhaps, how it is that <span
class="smcap">God</span> selects believing, rather than seeing,
on any other way of reception for special blessing.</p>
<p>Now, it is not necessary that <span class="smcap">God</span>
should account to us for what He does or wills.&nbsp; Creatures
of His hand, we are made for Him; dependents on His bounty, we
must thankfully receive it in any way and form of bestowal.&nbsp;
But still there are reasons which may be briefly suggested for
the selection of faith.</p>
<p>First, then, faith embodies the entire trustful devotion to
<span class="smcap">God</span>, which, above any assent to what
is proved, any following of what is seen or <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>heard,
magnifies the honour of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and so
sets forth His glory.&nbsp; It owns His truth, His providence,
His love, and prompts to a free-will, spiritual, glorifying
service of Him.&nbsp; Secondly, unless there are to be perpetual
miracles, faith alone can be permanently and universally
influential.&nbsp; If we are to be guided by sight, or hearing,
or touching, then the revelations to one generation would have to
be repeated to each following generation, and those of one
country performed again in every other.&nbsp; Thus <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> would have had to continue on earth,
to have visited every land, and been crucified and raised from
the dead in every land, or to have gathered all nations into
Judea to witness what was done; and this would have had to be
repeated over and over again to our fathers, to us, to our
children, or else some would have been without the necessary
influence to serve, and love, and depend on Him.&nbsp; And more
than this, since the sights we see and the sounds we hear, are
soon over, and leave but a faint remembrance behind, we should be
imperfectly influenced by them, when <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> ceased to speak; or when He passed
into another place we should be without our object of worship,
our instructor or hope.&nbsp; And even if these objections can be
met, still the perpetuity of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>visible presence, the beholding of
His miracles, and hearing of His words, would necessarily put a
stop to all worldly occupations; would make probation little more
than a name; would constrain men by natural influences to a
carnal or slavish adherence to Him, or would drive them into
reckless rebellion, and instant and irrevocable condemnation.</p>
<p>But again, faith is more blessed because it has greater
privileges&mdash;because it reveals more clearly, brings nearer,
than any sense could do.&nbsp; If you only hear a loved one, do
you not desire to see him?&nbsp; If you see him, are you not
unblessed unless you embrace him?&nbsp; And then, is there not an
influence, a way of communicating, that surpasses this&mdash;a
purer, a more spiritual influence, one which brings you together,
and keeps you together, and makes you one&mdash;love, which
surpasses, which is independent of, or only uses as accessories,
the bodily senses?&nbsp; We are too apt, brethren, to talk of
seeing as believing; to count sense above feeling; to exalt what
belongs to the body, above what belongs to the mind or
spirit.&nbsp; Doubtless, the error arises from the way in which
we speak of faith giving way to sight in heaven, as though the
eyes of the body only, and not the mind and spirit, were to
behold <span class="smcap">Christ</span> then; as though <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>mental and
spiritual perception were not better than bodily; as though there
were no assurance that faith is an abiding gift, and that,
therefore, while in heaven there will be much to gratify the eye
of the body, there will still be much more which faith alone can
realise.&nbsp; My brethren, the greatest eternal blessedness will
be vouchsafed to faith, and the greatest blessedness of this
state belongs to faith, because it is the exercise of man&rsquo;s
noblest and best, and most reliable faculties, far superior in
excellence, far more certain in ascertaining the truth, than
ears, or eyes, or hands.</p>
<p>Once more, faith is blessed above seeing, because it grasps a
set of truths, and enjoys a class of pleasures which are
different from those of the senses, and which the senses cannot
touch.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> the Father invisible
for ever, <span class="smcap">God</span> the Holy Ghost, blowing
like the wind where it listeth, so that you cannot see whence it
cometh and whither it goes, ministering angels, spiritual
influences, and consolations, and helps&mdash;what can ear, or
eye, or hand know of these?&nbsp; But faith knows them, hears
them, sees them, handles them, and joys in them.&nbsp; And this,
brethren, exhibits the nature of faith&rsquo;s blessedness; that
to it is revealed the whole spiritual world; that the evidence
which it <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>needs, the object of its worship, its Saviour, its <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, its hopes and fears, and
encouragements and promises are never absent, and never missed,
(but by its own dimness or voluntary blindness) whatever may
become of the outward signs and boding presences.&nbsp; Picture
to yourselves, brethren, the scene of that chamber where the
raised <span class="smcap">Christ</span> stood manifest, in the
posture of blessing, before His adoring disciples.&nbsp; Imagine
what Thomas had before felt, and what he now felt.&nbsp; Then
hear <span class="smcap">Christ</span> say&mdash;&ldquo;The bliss
of this moment might have been yours before, if you had sought to
attain it by faith, and not by sight; and what you now see may be
yours for ever, for in spirit I shall ever be with you, and by
faith you may ever behold Me!&nbsp; Blessed are they that have
not seen, and yet have believed&rdquo;; and that blessing,
brethren, was for us, if we will have it.&nbsp; If we believe,
then we are thus blessed.&nbsp; If we are not blessed, we may
be.&nbsp; O let us lay hold on this truth, let us cultivate
faith, let us pray to <span class="smcap">God</span> for an
increase of it, and let us perpetually exercise it in beholding
Him Who is ever with us, to pardon our faithless sins, to restore
us to His company, to breathe upon us peace and blessing.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">FAULTLESSNESS BEFORE GOD.</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">(INNOCENTS&rsquo; DAY.)</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Revelation</span>, <span class="smcap">xiv</span>.,
5.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>They are without fault before
the throne of</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Job</span> declares that <span
class="smcap">God</span> puts no trust in His saints; that He
charges His angels with folly; that in His sight the very heavens
are not clean.&nbsp; This language is, of course, figurative, and
not to be taken literally; but it well describes to us the
transcendent holiness of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and His
utter abhorrence of all evil.&nbsp; In comparison of Him, heaven
itself is not pure, and angels, endued with wisdom, swift and
constant to obey, delighting in His will, even these are not
perfect&mdash;fall far short of perfection before Him.&nbsp; Job
would show us the distance between <span class="smcap">God</span>
and man.&nbsp; St. John, however, in the chapter of my text,
would exhibit another truth, not contradictory, but rather
supplementary to Job&rsquo;s, namely, the nearness, through
grace, of man to <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; The
Apostle <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>is
describing, for the comfort and encouragement of the tried and
persecuted, a vision which he had seen of some of those who have
passed away from this world, and, as a kind of first-fruits, are
already with <span class="smcap">God</span> and the Lamb; and he
says, that &ldquo;in their mouth is found no guile; for they are
without fault before the throne of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without fault,&rdquo; means here, without spot or
blemish; not only free from actual transgression, but wholly
untainted by corruption of sin&mdash;not wanting in anything that
belongs to the perfect character of the approved of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>That man in his natural state is altogether faulty, that even
in his redeemed, and spiritualised, and sanctified state, while
here on earth, he has still many faults, are truths so plainly
taught, so proved to our reason and experience, that it would be
idle to enforce them.&nbsp; How, then, can he ever stand
faultless before the throne of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Now some would answer, that for
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> sake <span
class="smcap">God</span> overlooks, that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, by His merits, hides man&rsquo;s
faults; and so that the redeemed in heaven are not really
faultless, but that for <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
sake faultlessness is reckoned, imputed to them.&nbsp; This is
what may be called the popular answer to our question.&nbsp; But,
brethren, how utterly wrong it is seen to be, when we consider <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>that, in
order to exalt <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> mercy and
His wisdom in contriving justification, it sacrifices His truth
and His holiness.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> cannot
call the faulty faultless.&nbsp; He Who is Truth cannot enter
with His Holy Son (Who is also Truth) into a plan of deceit, by
which, to Himself, to them, to angels, to the whole universe, sin
shall be presented as holiness.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> may agree not to reckon with men for
their sins, to forget the past, on certain conditions to deal
with the faulty as if they were actually faultless; but He
cannot&mdash;I say it advisedly, it is beyond the limits of His
power, as regulated by His truth&mdash;He cannot call evil
good.&nbsp; And, brethren, besides, even if it were possible that
by some strange agreement with the Son, sinful man should be
passed off as holy, still his sin, while it remained, hide it,
disguise it, call it by what name you will, must separate from
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Charity might forbear to
punish it, or to make mention of it.&nbsp; Charity might even
gild it over; but Holiness deals not with the name, but with the
reality; and holiness must shrink from sin and thrust it
away.&nbsp; This ought to be the most readily perceived and
admitted of all Scripture truths, that <span
class="smcap">God</span> cannot tolerate near iniquity;
that&mdash;if I may venture reverently to use such
words&mdash;even if <span class="smcap">God</span> were <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>willing to
receive to Himself an unchanged sinner, the actual reception
would be morally impossible; the same heaven could not contain
holiness and sin!&nbsp; No, brethren, if the sinner is to enter
heaven, it must be, not because his name is changed, but his
nature; he must be actually without fault before <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; We see this to have been the case
with those described in the text: for it is expressly said,
&ldquo;In their mouth was found no guile.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observe,
it is not, <span class="smcap">God</span> mercifully overlooked
their guile for the sake of His dear Son, the Guileless One; He
charitably called them guileless; but &ldquo;in their mouth was
found (the testimony of truth to the searching of holiness) no
guile: yea, for they are altogether blameless, without spot or
blemish.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is an actual, not an imputed
faultlessness that is thus described.&nbsp; Now, how is it to be
attained by sinful men?&nbsp; And here comes in a second answer
of popular theology.&nbsp; At or after death, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> meets the departed, and by His
resurrection-power quickens that which was dead, purifies that
which was corrupt, spiritualises, sanctifies, and, as by a
miracle, converts the sinner into a perfect saint.&nbsp; This is
an answer only second in popularity to the one we have been
considering.&nbsp; Those who urge it, believe that man is
naturally depraved, <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>that, under grace, he retains much, almost all, his old
nature, that he is very faulty in deed, in will and
affections.&nbsp; They know that he must be faultless to gain
accession to heaven and dwell with <span class="smcap">God</span>
and the Lamb, and this faultlessness they hope for and pray for;
but there is no effort to acquire it; there is no concern for the
absence, the continued absence of it; it is regarded as
altogether a thing of the future; the free and perfect
gift&mdash;perfect at once&mdash;to the released soul and the
raised body.&nbsp; Men who hold this view, are often better than
their creed requires them to be.&nbsp; In love of <span
class="smcap">God</span> and devotion to Him, they strive to
abandon sin and cultivate holiness; but they have no definite
object in view of becoming faultless here, in order to be
faultless in heaven.&nbsp; They seem to believe that they cannot
get any nearer to faultlessness whatever they do, and that those
who have made no efforts, ay, have even led ungodly lives, and,
but for a few last sighs and ejaculations, would have died
ungodly deaths, are just as qualified, just as fit in many cases,
just as sure recipients of instantly converting and perfecting
grace in the next world!</p>
<p>But if this is so, why have we such solemn warnings, to the
effect that as the tree falls, so shall it lie?&nbsp; &ldquo;He
that is righteous, then, shall be <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>righteous still.&nbsp; He that is
filthy then, shall be filthy still.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why is it that
in the representations which we have of the Judgment, men are
always dealt with according to what they were in life,
&ldquo;Inasmuch as ye did it,&rdquo; &ldquo;Inasmuch as ye did it
not&rdquo;?&nbsp; Why is the pound taken away from him that did
not seek to increase it, and given to him who had gained ten
pounds, and the commentary subjoined, &ldquo;Unto every one which
hath shall be given, and from him that hath not, even that he
hath shall be taken away from him&rdquo;?&nbsp; Why is the
boaster of his privileges&mdash;&ldquo;In Thy name have I cast
out devils&rdquo;&mdash;instantly dismissed with the words,
&ldquo;Depart from me, I never knew you&rdquo;?&nbsp; Why are
they reproved who called <span class="smcap">Christ Lord</span>,
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, but did not the things which He
said?&nbsp; What did St. Peter mean when he exhorted &ldquo;Save
yourselves;&rdquo; and Paul, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation
with fear and trembling;&rdquo; &ldquo;Let him that thinketh he
standeth, take heed lest he fall;&rdquo; and <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> Himself, &ldquo;Behold, I come
quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every man according
as his work shall be;&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessed are they that do His
commandments that they may have right to the tree of life, and
may enter in through the gates into the city&rdquo;?&nbsp; Surely
all this, as with a voice from heaven, <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>calls on us to put away the delusion,
that mortal life is not a probation, that man has not a fitness
to acquire in this life, in order that he may be faultless in
heaven.&nbsp; The answer of truth, brethren, to the question,
&ldquo;How can man be faultless in heaven?&rdquo; is, briefly, By
praying, and striving, through the blessing of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, the grace of the Spirit of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and his own self-denial, and
diligence, and cultivated holiness, to become less and less
faulty here.&nbsp; After all, he will never, on this side of the
grave, be without spot or blemish, and perfect in holiness.&nbsp;
Whatever <span class="smcap">Christ</span> may do for him here,
he will still have much to be purged away, much to be quickened,
much to be glorified.&nbsp; But, be sure, there must be a
seed-time here and a growing here, if there is to be a harvest
hereafter.&nbsp; There must be a service, if there is to be a
reward; we must be faithful in a little, before we are made
rulers over much; there must be a fitness, a partial, a main
fitness acquired here, or no admission there to the inheritance
of the Saints in light.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> work in us hereafter is not a
transforming, but a completing, a finishing, a perfecting
work.&nbsp; &ldquo;To him that hath&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that
has made use of and improved what he hath&mdash;&ldquo;to him
more shall be given,&rdquo; and he shall abound.&nbsp; He who has
traced <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>in
his soul and life the outline of the features of the blessed
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, shall have the likeness filled
up and finished by the Divine artist, and be wholly conformed to
His image.&nbsp; He who has kept down the flesh, shall have the
power of the flesh destroyed in him.&nbsp; He who has sought
after holiness, shall be made perfect.&nbsp; A great change; much
taken away, much added, but not a transformation.&nbsp; A great
work, which can only be done then, and only by <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; but which will fail to be done then
if materials are not provided for it now; if the foundation has
not been laid, and the walls have not been raised, and all made
ready for the roof of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
adding, and the capping of the tower of glory.&nbsp; Yes; this is
the qualification, without which you cannot be received, but,
having it, cannot be refused.&nbsp; Labour and pray to be
faultless here, and <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shall at
the end perfect your faultlessness, and shall present you
faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding
joy.&nbsp; But the text seems to speak not of those who had
washed away defilements, had secured pardon of offences, had
repaired faults and made up deficiencies, in short, had been
sinners, but, under the operation of the spirit of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, were become saints; but of those who
never had been faulty, spotted, or blemished <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>&ldquo;These
are they which were not defiled with women, for they are
virgins.&nbsp; These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever
He goeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, there must have been the spot
and blemish of original sin; but, apart from this&mdash;which
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> applied purifying power
and all-sufficient merits would entirely remove&mdash;there seems
to have been in the lives of these persons no actual sin, no
omission of righteousness.&nbsp; Now, as there is no man that
liveth and sinneth not, it has been conjectured that the vision
here exhibits those who were taken away to <span
class="smcap">God</span> in their infancy, before they had the
power or the will to do good or evil, and who, therefore, as far
as actual deeds and feelings are concerned, not by work, or
grace, or conviction, but absolutely and from the first were
faultless: and probably the selection of the description as the
Gospel for this day, the festival of the Holy Innocents, has gone
far to confirm this conjecture.&nbsp; But, brethren, this surely
is not the meaning, at least the full meaning, of the
words.&nbsp; They describe freedom from defilement and following
of the Lamb as things that might have been otherwise.&nbsp; They
hold up for the example and encouragement of those who were
tempted to lust, and to depart from following the living <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, the praise and <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>happiness of
those who are without fault in these respects; and therefore they
suggest to us, I think, as the most profitable and foremost
thought, the blessedness, the superior blessedness of those who
never have contracted sin, nor failed in holiness.</p>
<p>Men sometimes seem to fancy that the most glorious character
in heaven, the object of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
fondest love, will be the once deep-stained and wholly defiled,
that have been washed in <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> blood till they are become
whiter than snow, the reckless, and rebellious, and blaspheming,
who have been subdued and converted; and that in comparison of
these, the mainly regular righteous life will almost pass
unnoticed.&nbsp; It is easy to account for the supposition.&nbsp;
We read, without due consideration, of her that sinned much, and
was forgiven much, and therefore loved much; of the returned
prodigal rejoiced over more than the son who had remained at
home; of the joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more
than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance; of
publicans and harlots going into the kingdom of heaven before
priests and scribes.&nbsp; We forget that these things were said
to men who were not really righteous, but self-sufficient; that
they were an accommodation to their own kind of reasoning; that
they were the justification <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>of special works and feelings, and
peculiar demonstrations.&nbsp; Surely we are not to understand by
them anything more than that sinners were <i>at times</i> more in
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> thoughts than saints;
that on the recovery of one lost sheep, the joy over that one
caused the rest for the moment to be put out of
remembrance.&nbsp; Surely we are not to understand that <span
class="smcap">God</span> has less love for, and shows less favour
to those who have uniformly served and honoured Him, than to
those whose life has been one of contempt and rebellion, who have
refused to accept Him till they had made trial of all else; that
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> power and glory are more
magnified in the ultimate conversion of such a sinner, than in
the steady control and improvement of a life-long saint; that in
themselves the reformed drunkards and defiled are better than
those who were always sober and pure; that their memories are
more blissful, and their themes of praise more satisfactory; that
they are even equal in favour, in bliss, in manifested honour to
those who were undefiled and consistently obedient, whom Holy
Scripture distinguishes on this very account, of whom it relates,
that they sing a song which no other can learn, signifying that
they have a peculiar privilege and a peculiar joy!&nbsp;
Brethren, be sure it is not so.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> is abundantly <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>gracious to all who call upon Him,
late as well as early.&nbsp; No one, whatever his past life,
shall be refused who comes to Him through <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; In his late righteousness all
his former sins shall be forgiven and forgotten; they shall not
once be mentioned unto him.&nbsp; He shall have too, the joy of
the righteous, and shall dwell with <span
class="smcap">God</span> in heaven; but still He Who makes one
star to differ from another in glory, Who bestows different
measures of reward upon different capacities, and different
attainments, has a special interest and a superior blessedness
for those who have never been stained, who have always stayed in
their father&rsquo;s house, and have obeyed His will and loved
His voice.&nbsp; In themselves they are dearer to Him, as more
like <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>; and for them, He has seats
closer to the throne of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and
offices of honour near His person.</p>
<p>If this is so, if &ldquo;faultlessness,&rdquo; in the sense of
never blotted, never imperfect, is the state that is most
blessed, then, brethren, we might perhaps be tempted to envy the
fate of those whom we commemorate to-day, who suffered so early
for <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> sake, and as soon
almost as they were born, were put to death.&nbsp; We might
judge, too, that the little ones whom <span
class="smcap">God</span> so frequently takes away so soon after
lending them, are summoned <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>to a higher blessedness than we can
ever know; and therefore that not only would it have been gain to
die in infancy, but that it is positive loss to live to years of
discretion and responsibility.&nbsp; Let us not err herein.&nbsp;
We believe that the dear innocents, whose first consciousness is
of bliss in heaven, whose reason begins to develop, and their
will to exercise itself, only when sin is impossible, are not
only unspeakably blessed, but that <span class="smcap">God</span>
specially loves them, and folds them to His bosom (as we did
here), because of that innocence: no guile, no
defilement&mdash;all simplicity and trust.&nbsp; Thankful then in
their sober moments are all bereaved parents who are assured of
their departed little ones&rsquo; eternal safety, and are spared
the fears and anxieties, the heartrending realisation of
self-will developed, and the world&rsquo;s evil example followed,
and the devil triumphant.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> gave, and the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> hath taken away; and, in that He has
taken away, from the evil to come, Oh! blessed be the name of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>But, brethren, it is only because we fear for the future, that
we thankfully accept such a present.&nbsp; Could we be sure that
our little ones would remain faultless, that they would not abuse
the world, nor fall into great error or misery, that they would
grow in grace, and in the <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>fear of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, and at length surely attain to glory;
then, not from selfishness, but for their sakes, we should covet
length of days for them.&nbsp; And rightly, for there is a better
faultlessness, and a correspondingly higher blessedness than that
of infants, who were allowed no opportunity (and possessed no
power) to contract fault: it is the faultlessness of those who
shrink from the allowed opportunity, who restrain the possessed
power, and overcome the persuading will, who pass through the
fire without the smell of it being left on their garments, who
make manifest by a life of self-denials, and resistances to
temptations, and patience and perseverance in well-doing, their
intelligent deliberate love of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and hatred of evil.&nbsp; These are the tried, the eagerly
accepted, the specially loved.&nbsp; These do the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> work, and set forth the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> glory.&nbsp; These shall indeed
be welcomed with a &ldquo;Well-done good and faithful
servant,&rdquo; for them shall be reserved the best seats on the
right hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>; and they shall joy
in <span class="smcap">God</span>, and <span
class="smcap">God</span> in them, with a peculiar joy, for they
are likest unto <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, Whose
spotlessness was preserved among so many defilements, Who with
heart, and mind, and life, consistently, unceasingly served <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and Who therefore is highly exalted,
and has a name which is above all other names.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>Oh it
is no mean privilege, brethren, which you forego, when you leave
the ranks of the faultless, when you shrink from duty, or yield
to sinful pleasure, or contract any stain of ungodliness.&nbsp;
Say not, &ldquo;It is only for once.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will surely
be for more than once; but if it were not, still from being
faultless that <i>once</i> makes you blotted and blemished.&nbsp;
Say not, &ldquo;I can repent by and by, and <span
class="smcap">God</span> of His mercy will accept me, and I shall
be myself again.&rdquo;&nbsp; You may not live to repent.&nbsp;
Sin may disincline, the Spirit provoked may leave you; but even
if you do repent&mdash;though <span class="smcap">God</span> will
undoubtedly forgive, and in a sense restore you&mdash;remember,
you can never be as you were before.&nbsp; You may be cleansed,
but not as at first clean; admitted to heaven, but not to the
band of the one hundred and forty-four thousand of undefiled;
joined to the glorious choir of the redeemed, but not allowed,
not able to sing the peculiar song of the faultless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what,&rdquo; some would say, &ldquo;is the use of
this preaching?&nbsp; We are all already faulty; we can none of
us have a place among these choice first fruits of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> harvest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Brethren,
faultlessness, pure faultlessness, is no longer ours; but
comparative faultlessness (and Bible faultlessness, after all, is
only comparative freedom from wilful <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>sin) may, and, I trust, does pertain
to many of us; and for each degree of nearness to faultlessness,
if I understand the Bible aright, there is its peculiar
reward.&nbsp; I would put you on your guard against losing that
reward, by sinking to a lower level.&nbsp; I would urge you to
hold fast what you have, to subdue yourselves, to resist the
world and the devil, to be ever on the watch against danger, and
to flee speedily from temptation, if it is too strong to fight
against, to seek strength and sanctification in means of grace,
to pray constantly (and strive constantly to make good your
prayer), that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> would keep you
from falling, and finally present you faultless before the
presence of His glory with exceeding joy.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PAST MERCIES REVIEWED.</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">(NEW YEAR&rsquo;S EVE.)</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Genesis</span>, <span class="smcap">xxxii</span>.,
10.</p>
<p><i>I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies</i>, <i>and
of all the truth</i>, <i>which thou hast showed unto Thy
servant</i>; <i>for with my staff I passed over this Jordan</i>;
<i>and now I am become two bands</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are Jacob&rsquo;s
words.&nbsp; They form part of the prayer which he offered to
<span class="smcap">God</span>, when, on his return from Haran,
he found that Esau was coming out against him with four hundred
men.</p>
<p>Mingled feelings must have possessed Jacob at this time;
strange remembrances must have been his!&nbsp; Twenty years ago
he had passed over that Jordan&mdash;near which he now
stood&mdash;in flight from an enraged brother, meditating and
preparing vengeance for an act of fraudulent injury.&nbsp; What a
weary pilgrimage he had since followed; what <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>sorrows, what
desolations had possessed his aching heart; how he had toiled and
suffered wrong; even now was fleeing from it!&nbsp; Yet, those
twenty years gone, he was coming back, not to the prospect of
peace and happiness, not to the hope that his brother had
forgotten his vengeance, or that he would easily be reconciled to
him; but to face a mindful, aggravated avenger, strengthened by
four hundred followers.&nbsp; Surely he had fled and been in
exile to no purpose!&nbsp; Surely, by deferring it, he had
increased his trouble!&nbsp; It must have been that Jacob now
acutely remembered the cause of Esau&rsquo;s anger; that he
meditated on the mean advantage that he had taken, the base fraud
to which he had been a party, the lying, the profanity of his
lips, the evil deeds which led to evil consequences.&nbsp; Ah!
now he felt that man cannot sin with impunity, that transgression
and punishment are bound together as cause and effect, that
vengeance, though it tarry, though it slumber, though we run from
it, and hide from it many, many days, will yet accomplish its
purpose, will surely repay!&nbsp; Yes; and did he not feel that
vengeance had even followed him; that he had been its victim all
those twenty years; that the frauds of Laban, from first to last,
and the strifes and dissensions of his own household <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>were the
fruits of his deceit; that <span class="smcap">God</span> had
allowed them, that in a way He had caused them in retaliation, in
punishment of his sin!&nbsp; What an experience to him, what a
proof to us, my brethren, that sin will surely find us out!</p>
<p>But Jacob must have had other and different
thoughts&mdash;thoughts which preponderated.&nbsp; As he called
to mind his first passage over Jordan, did not he remember the
wonderful vision that was vouchsafed him of angels descending to
earth, ascending to heaven, in token of Divine providence, of the
intercourse between man and <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp;
Did he not remember the Voice which promised to be with him, to
keep him in all places whither he went, to bring him again to
this land, to give it to him and to his seed after him?&nbsp; Did
he not look along those twenty years, and remember that <span
class="smcap">God</span> had been with him, and that, by His
command, he was now coming back; and did he not hope, yes, even
against hope, that <span class="smcap">God</span> would be with
him in the coming struggle, that He would crown His mercy and
goodness with a present success, and with the establishment of
himself and his seed in the promised land?&nbsp; And one other
remembrance surely he had.&nbsp; He remembered the vow which in
the fresh reverence of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
presence, in glad and grateful acceptance of His <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>promises, he
had solemnly made, &ldquo;The <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
shall be my <span class="smcap">God</span>;&rdquo; and he must
have remembered how often he had forgotten that vow, how
generally he had slightly regarded it.&nbsp; These I suppose to
have been the feelings and remembrances which filled the breast
of Jacob, when he uttered the prayer in which our text
occurs.&nbsp; Observe how that prayer exhibits the right ordering
of these feelings, making prominent, putting uppermost thoughts
and acknowledgments of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
goodness; and, in the moment of greatest peril, pausing to review
mercies, and to give thanks!&nbsp; There is no bitter lamentation
of his hard lot throughout those years of promised blessing;
there is no pleading with <span class="smcap">God</span>, that if
he had sinned he had surely been punished enough; there is no
mention of the merits of his contrite heart and amended life;
there is no angry feeling against Esau, no supplication that
<span class="smcap">God</span> would smite and confound
him.&nbsp; It is a godly, a model prayer.&nbsp; Betaking himself
to <span class="smcap">God</span> in the hour of danger, as his
only confidence and help, he humbly urges no personal claim,
but&mdash;that he is in the place of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> commanding.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Thou <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that saidst
unto me Return unto thy country and unto thy kindred,&rsquo; I
did not recklessly run into danger, I did not voluntarily <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>gratify the
natural yearning of my poor heart.&nbsp; Thou broughtest me here,
O <span class="smcap">Lord</span> protect me here;&rdquo; and
then having put forth himself, though but such a little way, and
coming to consider <span class="smcap">God</span>, Who had shown
him such wondrous goodness, Who had fulfilled for him so
truthfully all His promises, he exclaims, &ldquo;I am not worthy
of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou
hast showed unto Thy servant: for with my staff&mdash;as a
solitary, poor individual&mdash;I passed over this Jordan, and
now I am become two bands.&nbsp; Deliver me, I pray
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seems to me, brethren, a fit theme for a sermon on New
Year&rsquo;s Eve.&nbsp; Jacob, come back from Haran to Jordan,
where he had made a covenant with <span class="smcap">God</span>,
may well typify our return to-night to the sanctuary of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, whence we went forth refreshed and
pledged last New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&nbsp; Jacob&rsquo;s
reflections&mdash;he is the pattern of a mediator&mdash;may well
provoke us to ask of the days that are past, to remember all the
way which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> our <span
class="smcap">God</span> has led us.&nbsp; Jacob&rsquo;s prayer
shows us how to speak to <span class="smcap">God</span>, what we
should feel in His presence on such an occasion as this, how to
propitiate Him, and to secure His defence and blessing in what
lies before us.</p>
<p>I will not attempt, brethren, to picture the <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>circumstances
through which you have passed in the year which is now all but
ended; many of them I could only guess at, many of them, to me,
would be unimaginable.&nbsp; Recall them for yourselves and
meditate on them.&nbsp; They will teach you much, and influence
you much.&nbsp; I will address you simply as those who have made
a halt in the journey of life, and who want now <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> blessing in the known and
unknown dangers, anxieties, sufferings, and labours that lie
before you in the coming year.</p>
<p>Well: let your requests be made known unto <span
class="smcap">God</span> with prayer; above all&mdash;yes! I mean
it&mdash;<i>above all</i>, with thanksgiving.</p>
<p>But, first, before you approach <span
class="smcap">God</span>, to speak to Him, to ask of Him, to
thank Him, be sure that you can say to Him, &ldquo;I am in the
way of Thy commandments.&rdquo;&nbsp; If at this moment you are
contentedly different from what you know He would have you to be;
if you indulge, or do not resolutely renounce any besetting sin;
if you deliberately neglect any positive duty; if in will and
affections, and aims, you are worldly and selfish, and do not
seek to be otherwise; if you are planning anything, or hoping for
anything which <span class="smcap">God</span> does not approve;
if you are shrinking from, desiring to avoid, what He appoints;
if <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>you
have not made up your minds to try to be holy, to walk in the way
of righteousness; then, brethren, you are disqualified to pray to
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; He hears not such.&nbsp; He
has made no promises to them: they are not His.&nbsp; Go fashion
yourselves (He will mercifully give you grace to do it) into the
character that He loves; get you into the paths that He has
marked out; turn your face towards the Holy Land, and then come
to tell Him of your felt unworthiness, to speak His praise, to
intreat Him to be with you, to defend and prosper you; and be
sure you shall be welcomed and blessed.</p>
<p>But, supposing you not disqualified to come, supposing you
bent on coming, consider now your right posture and deportment
before <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Ask nothing of
right, ask all out of felt unworthiness, and that, not simply the
unworthiness of the stranger, and alien, who want mercies which
they have never known, and speak to a <span
class="smcap">God</span> that has not hitherto been their <span
class="smcap">God</span>, as the publican cried, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> be merciful to me a sinner;&rdquo; but
such an unworthiness as belonged to the prodigal, such as he felt
and groaned under, when, reflecting on all the love and
blessedness which he had experienced in his father&rsquo;s house,
and had despised, and sinned against, and seeing the Father <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>coming
towards him, ready to pardon, ready to embrace, ready to lead him
home again, he was humbled to the very dust before Him, on
account of his goodness, and declared himself unworthy to be
called His son.&nbsp; Oh, my brethren, if you do not feel
unworthy, when you approach the all-good and all-holy <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and if the feeling is not one
enlightened by, and full of the remembrances of blessings already
received, you are unfit to ask for further blessings.&nbsp; Not
to have used <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> blessings is
great indignity; not to be thankful for them is base ingratitude;
but not to feel, that whether used or not used, appreciated or
not appreciated, they are many and undeserved&mdash;this is to
deny that you ever received them, or, claiming them as a right,
to defy <span class="smcap">God</span> to withhold them!&nbsp;
Cultivate then, I pray you, this feeling of unworthiness; and,
that you may do so the more readily, review the mercies, the
promises made true which you have received; and tell out their
number, their kind, and their magnitude to the <span
class="smcap">God</span> Who gave them, and would have them
acknowledged.&nbsp; &ldquo;With my staff I passed over this
Jordan, and now I am become two bands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now the
argument of these words is, &ldquo;I do not come to Thee,
professing that I am a fit person to be helped, but I claim Thee
as a <span class="smcap">God</span> who are wont to help such as
I <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>am.&nbsp; I am not worthy of the least of Thy mercies:
but yet Thou hast shown me marvellous mercies.&nbsp; I possess
now the evidences and pledges of Thy goodness.&nbsp; Therefore I
pray for, I humbly count on further blessing, not because I am a
holy man, but because Thou art a good <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and My good <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is an argument which
prevails with <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; He is pleased
to see that we recognise His former gifts, that we make
<i>them</i>&mdash;and not ourselves, our love of Him, our
obedience, our prayers, and fastings, and study of His Word, and
use of His grace&mdash;the ground of application.&nbsp; He likes
that His consistent faithfulness should be invoked; that since He
has made a beginning, just on that very account, He should be
looked to (so as it be humbly), to continue His work, and to
accomplish it.&nbsp; When you go to <span
class="smcap">God</span> to ask for fresh blessings, you cannot
take with you better and more effectual words than those which
make mention of, which exhibit as promises and pledges, what you
have already received.</p>
<p>But these words are not simply an argument for further help;
they are, besides, a free acknowledgment, a pure praise of what
has been given.&nbsp; They may be the plea of a beseeching heart,
but they are besides the tribute of a grateful heart; <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>and it is
in this sense, brethren, that I specially wish you to adopt them
to-night, and to make them a thanksgiving to <span
class="smcap">God</span> for past mercies reviewed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am
become two bands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jacob might have found mercies
enough to enlist his gratitude in any one year, or circumstance
of his exile and pilgrimage, and doubtless he reviewed each and
all particularly; but in his speech he comprehended all in a
general mention of them, and summed them up, and demonstrated
them by pointing to their effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I am become
two bands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Review your past mercies, consider how
<span class="smcap">God</span> has been with you at all times,
and has ever been doing you good.&nbsp; Call to mind what
progress you have been able to make spiritual or temporal; what
success has attended you; what friends have been given you; what
dangers you have narrowly escaped; what sicknesses recovered
from; what wounds been healed, what troubles overcome, what tears
staunched.&nbsp; Have they not caused you, like Jacob, to
increase from the solitariness and poverty of that passing over
Jordan, to the riches and prosperity of the two bands?&nbsp;
Perhaps you say, you cannot trace such progress; you are much the
same outwardly and inwardly, as you have been from the time that
you can first <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>remember.&nbsp; Then, brethren, you can furnish your
own testimony, that <span class="smcap">God</span> has dealt
better with you than He did with Jacob, that your first state,
your continued state has been all like his last.&nbsp; O discern
and bless <span class="smcap">God</span> for those least heeded
but greatest mercies, the mercies which come to us at the
beginning, and follow us all the days of our life&mdash;the
continued prosperity of our family, the continued harmony and
love, the bread always sure, the right understanding early
implanted, the fear of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> from
our youth.&nbsp; There is a way of travelling in our days which
is so smooth, that often we cannot tell that we are moving; and
there is a manner of blessing, so uninterrupted, so uniform, so
without roughnesses and stoppages and ups and downs, that if we
be not on the lookout, we may fancy that we are not blessed at
all.&nbsp; Let not this be your case.&nbsp; Do not refuse to be
grateful, because all goes well with you, because there is
nothing that needs to be supplied, because nothing is taken away
from you.&nbsp; Rather, let the measure of your blessedness be
also the measure of your praise and the strength of your
resolution.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely goodness and mercy have followed
me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But your object, perhaps, &ldquo;Mine has not been <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>this life
of uninterrupted prosperity, but, on the contrary, one of
continued adversity.&nbsp; It is Jacob&rsquo;s first, not his
last estate, that has been always mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; What do you
mean?&nbsp; That you were not born rich, nor influential, nor of
honoured family?&nbsp; That you have not the wisdom of the
philosopher, the dignity of the prince, the opulence of the
successful merchant, the leisure of independent private
life?&nbsp; That may be.&nbsp; Your state may be the reverse of
all this, and yet be the state of the &ldquo;two
bands.&rdquo;&nbsp; External prosperity in Jacob&rsquo;s time was
commonly, yet not always, the sign of spiritual blessings; in
Gospel days, with our better light, and greater power of
appreciation of the reality, the sign is not so often afforded,
frequently the most favoured are without it; yea, and often it
abides with the unblessed as the mocking substitute for true
blessedness.&nbsp; If you are without <span
class="smcap">God</span> in the world; if you do not feel Him
about your bed, and about your path; if you do not live in His
fear, and hope for His mercies, and His rewards; if the thought
of Him does not moderate your worldly joy, and direct your aims,
and leaven your worldly work; if His comfort does not dry your
tears, His strength support you, His grace sanctify you,
then&mdash;no matter what your outward state, and <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>your
possessions, your powers, your happiness&mdash;you are poor and
unblessed.&nbsp; But if He is thus with you in all your ways, if
you have resolved, and are keeping the resolution, &ldquo;The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall be my <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; then is yours the state, or it
is growing towards the state of the &ldquo;two
bands.&rdquo;&nbsp; One more objection somewhat akin to this
last, must be answered.&nbsp; There are some who say, &ldquo;Mine
was once the state of the two bands: it has long since
been&mdash;or it is fast becoming&mdash;solitariness and the
single staff.&nbsp; All thing are against me.&nbsp; Nothing that
I put my hand to seems to prosper; I come into misfortune; the
fountains of joy are dried up; my hope, my stay, are taken from
me.&nbsp; When I look back upon the past, I look as it were up an
incline down which I have rolled, or towards a pinnacle whence I
have been cast down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, of course, my brethren,
all this may be the result of the displeasure of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, consequent upon your sin, or neglect of
Him.&nbsp; Outward adversity is sometimes the effect of His
wrath, sometimes it is the chastisement of displeasure, and the
discipline of correction.&nbsp; If then in your heart, you know
that you deserve such wrath, or need such correction (even then
it is a blessing, and you ought to praise <span
class="smcap">God</span> for it, but still) you may be sure that
<a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>it is
the mark of disapprobation, something for you to grieve over, and
seek to have removed.&nbsp; But if the testimony of your
conscience is that you walk with <span class="smcap">God</span>,
then are these so-called reverses very blessings, not declines
but advances, not hindrances but helps, tokens of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> love upraisings of you towards
heaven.&nbsp; Oh be like Jacob; count all mercy, get rid of
selfishness, and meditate as he did, and you will prove that all
is mercy, and proclaim it!&nbsp; You will find, for instance,
that the loss of wealth took away with it the idol of your
worship, the minister of your excessive pleasure; that altered
position broke down your pride; that worldly sorrow led you to
seek heavenly comfort; that the perfidy of so-called friends made
you cease to put your trust in man, and caused you to rely on the
friend that sticketh closer than a brother; that sickness and
infirmity reminded you of death, and stimulated you to
preparation for judgment; that the loss of those you loved,
uprooted your clingings to earth, linked you to heaven, revealed
to you One whom you knew not; Whom above all you ought to love;
Who is better to you than sons and daughters; Who is the true and
abiding Father of the fatherless, and <span
class="smcap">God</span> of the widow.&nbsp; No matter what your
circumstances, how many <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>your troubles, I tell you on the
authority of God&rsquo;s Word, that if you love Him, they all
work together for your good; yea, they are all good in
themselves.&nbsp; You will find them so, if you rightly review
them, and each of you will be able to say, as truthfully as Jacob
did, with much more meaning, because of your better knowledge and
superior blessedness in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
&ldquo;I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all
the truth, which Thou hast showed unto my servant . . . I am
become two bands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Try to feel this, brethren, and to express it this night to
<span class="smcap">God</span>; to tell out your praises for the
mercies of your past life, and, in the review of them, to pledge
yourselves to Him, that you will strive henceforth to recognise
blessings more quickly, to use them better, to be more grateful
for them.&nbsp; Be these the thoughts and vows with which you
consecrate the last hours of a dying year.&nbsp; But, knowing
that so soon as you set out again, your enemy, whom sin has given
the advantage over you, will come to meet you, to smite you, to
turn you back from the Holy Land, forget not this night to cry,
&ldquo;Deliver me, I pray Thee, O <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; Take away from me the sin which
exposes me to assaults, which makes me vulnerable.&nbsp; Give me
Thy strength: go before <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>me with thy blessing.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Do this, brethren, persevere in it day after day, night after
night: wrestle with God, refuse to let Him go&mdash;you shall
surely prevail: <span class="smcap">God</span> will yield all you
ask; and, in honour of your victory, He will change your name
from Jacob to Israel, that is, you shall no longer be remembered
by the name of your deceit and your sin.&nbsp; You shall be
known, known to angels, known to Him, as princes, and prevailers
with <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">WORKING FOR GOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
John</span>, <span class="smcap">ix</span>., 4.</p>
<p><i>I must work the works of Him that sent me</i>, <i>while it
is day</i>: <i>the night cometh</i>, <i>when no man can
work</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <span class="smcap">dwell</span> not on these words in their
relation to the context.&nbsp; I pause not to consider whether
their utterance was a justification of the Sabbath-day miracle
that was presently to be performed&mdash;&ldquo;no opportunity
must be lost, no delay allowed of working the works of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rdquo;&mdash;or whether they were but
the thinking and resolving aloud (so characteristic of our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>), by which He kept ever in mind His
great mission, by which He continually stimulated and pressed on
that human nature of His; willing indeed, but yet weak, though
not sinful; and made it vigorously industrious in the work of
<span class="smcap">God</span>; or whether, once more, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> here but personified Christians, and
spoke not of Himself, not to keep Himself <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>mindful and
intent upon His work, but as their example and representative, as
though He had said, &ldquo;A work of <span
class="smcap">God</span> will now be manifested in the
restoration of this blind man.&nbsp; It will not be delayed till
the Sabbath is over.&nbsp; See me serving <span
class="smcap">God</span> and serving Him now, by instant doing of
all possible work.&nbsp; Consider me your example.&nbsp; Let this
be your resolution, &lsquo;I must work the works of Him that sent
me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can
work.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It matters little to us what feeling or
motive immediately prompted our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
to speak the text.&nbsp; His words at once commend themselves to
us as those which we may, which we ought to adopt, even if they
belong primarily to Him; which, rather, since they were the
ruling maxim of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, must be the
ruling maxim of Christians.</p>
<p>Well, then, these are our words (and <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> has shown us how to fulfil them),
&ldquo;I must work the works of Him that sent me, while it is
day: the night cometh, when no man can work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him that sent me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Have we yet to learn, my
brethren, that <span class="smcap">God</span> sent us into this
world; that we came not here by chance, or on our own account;
that we are not independent beings, free to wander about or
linger to do, or forbear to do, as we please?&nbsp; By the
will&mdash;for the accomplishment <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>of the purposes&mdash;of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, we are here on a mission, His
messengers, His agents, workers for Him.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> has made all things for His own use and
glory.&nbsp; None of us liveth unto himself&mdash;He sent us
forth.&nbsp; He gave us a charge.&nbsp; He watches to see what we
do with it.&nbsp; He waits for our return; rather, He appoints,
and, whensoever He will, enforces our return.&nbsp; And what is
the mission?&nbsp; What has He sent us to do?&nbsp; To work the
works of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and make them manifest,
to promote, to show forth His glory, to become ourselves all that
He would have us to be, and to light and guide others to the same
end.&nbsp; Work for <span class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp; How few
ever think of such a thing!&nbsp; Work for themselves (and for
others like themselves) for food to eat and raiment to put on,
for money, for power, for fame, for pleasure; men understand
this; they acknowledge the necessity of it, or the inviting,
constraining desirableness of it, and they do it&mdash;do it
generally, do it well, and heartily.&nbsp; A really idle man, a
man that works not some works, is a rarity, an object of contempt
when he is seen, a despiser of himself.&nbsp; But, work for <span
class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp; How many do that?&nbsp; Who does
it heartily, and does it well?&nbsp; Whose thoughts are full of
it, whose deeds accomplish it?&nbsp; What fruits come of
it?&nbsp; There are some, not a few, <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>thank <span
class="smcap">God</span>! who can give a satisfactory answer to
such questions; whose lives continually give it, and whom <span
class="smcap">God</span>, for their works&rsquo; sake in <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, greatly approves.&nbsp; But I speak
now to the many, yea, I speak to all; for the work of <span
class="smcap">God</span> so generally neglected, is by none
perfectly performed.&nbsp; To all, then, I solemnly address the
questions: &ldquo;Do you work for <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What work do you work
for Him?&rdquo;&nbsp; You are tempted to justify
yourselves.&nbsp; You are not the unbelieving, and rebellious,
and profane of our race.&nbsp; You recognise a <span
class="smcap">God</span> of providence and grace, a moral ruler
of the world, a waiting Judge.&nbsp; To this <span
class="smcap">God</span> you say your prayers, His word you read,
and reverence, and receive.&nbsp; To Him you dedicate at least
several hours of each seventh day; by His commandments you order
your daily life.&nbsp; You do no wrong to your neighbour by word
or deed; you strive to purify and sanctify your very feelings and
thoughts; you believe in a Saviour; you accept His salvation; you
try to love Him; you partake of His means of grace; you rest in
Him, and look to Him for final redemption, and something you do
occasionally by way of persuading others; and something you give
for the furtherance of religious works.&nbsp; It is well,
brethren, if you do this; if you go through the <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>form, and
do not inwardly contradict what is outward, but rather incline to
it.</p>
<p>It is well, I say, because it is hopeful, it will, by grace,
lead you farther; but if in your heart and soul you recognise
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and believe in a Saviour, then I
am sure that you will not adduce what I have mentioned as
specimens of the works of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp;
Acknowledgments that <span class="smcap">God</span> ought to be
served, pledges of service, they may be, but works they are
not.&nbsp; And yet some, perhaps, would urge, &ldquo;When the
question was put, &lsquo;What must we do that we may work the
works of <span class="smcap">God</span>?&rsquo; did not <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> answer, &lsquo;This is the work of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, that ye believe on Him whom He
hath sent&rdquo;? and, say they, &ldquo;Does not this show that
literal working, as we work in and for the world, is not what
<span class="smcap">God</span> demands; that it is rather a
mental assent, an entertaining and exercising of feelings, a
believing, a thankful, a sanctifying remembrance of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> work; a trust in it, a
carefulness to do nothing that will render it ineffectual for our
salvation, that is required of us?&nbsp; Surely, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> has done the work Himself; we have
but to accept it thankfully, and wait for it faithfully and
holily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, my brethren, it may be easily shown that this is not
believing in Him whom <span class="smcap">God</span> hath
sent.&nbsp; <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>To believe in Him is to embrace Him as the Author, and
Finisher, and Giver of Salvation; to be assured that salvation
can only be had from Him, in Him, and on His terms; to learn of
Him, therefore&mdash;and, of course, of His Apostles and
Evangelists after Him, for to them even clearer teaching was
intrusted&mdash;what are the terms, and then to fulfil them
resolutely and precisely.&nbsp; Do you need that I should quote
the actual words, the chapter, and verse, in which <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, through the Spirit, tells us, that
He has redeemed us to Himself; that He has purchased us for a
peculiar people zealous of good works; that He has left us a
definite work to do against His return; that on His return He
will judge and reward us by our works; that He will condemn as
workers against Him those who have not worked for Him; that it is
vain to acknowledge Him and not do the things that He bids; that
He has left us an example that we should follow His steps, in
that He fulfilled all righteousness, and went about doing good,
and proposed to Himself, as that which must be done, and done
heartily and without delay, the works and the manifesting of the
works of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and made it His meat and
drink to do the Father&rsquo;s will; that He has said plainly,
that whosoever would not take up the cross and <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>follow Him
could not be His disciple.&nbsp; O wo to those who dare to say
this means: Sit still in worldliness, and look at and admire Him
doing the labour and pursuing the path of godliness&mdash;that He
has attached all His promises to certain deeds; that He is ever
represented as judging, not what men have thought and felt, but
what they have done and become by doing; that by the Spirit He
has commanded &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and
trembling;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whether ye eat or drink, or
whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of <span
class="smcap">God</span>;&rdquo; and &ldquo;He that gathereth
not, scattereth abroad&rdquo;?&nbsp; Oh, my brethren, let us be
honest; we know, we dare not deny it, that a work, rather that
many works are imposed upon us by <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and that it will not do for us merely to think of them, to sigh
over them, to approach them carelessly, reluctantly, to call
preferred employments by their name; but that with clear
understanding with heart-devotion, with constant application and
real labour, we must do the works of Him that sent us.</p>
<p>And, now, what are the works?</p>
<p>The first, and most vitally important, is, to &ldquo;work out
our own salvation;&rdquo; not to attempt of ourselves to undo
what Adam did; not by any <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>course of zealous doing to seek to
recommend ourselves to <span class="smcap">God</span> as
deserving a reward, to propose to purchase heaven, to go to <span
class="smcap">God</span> the Father directly for it, and expect
to get it from Him, either as a right or as a gift of compassion:
but, knowing that it is only to be had of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, to seek it from <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> in appointed ways, in the measure, on
the conditions which He has prescribed for all, and to fulfil the
conditions.&nbsp; We are not naturally born in grace; we do not
naturally inherit glory.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
by right, the Saviour of all men, is, in fact,
&ldquo;specially&rdquo; only the Saviour of them that believe; of
them who actually apply to Him and depend on Him, and remain in
communion with Him for grace; who serve Him by fulfilling His
commands and copying His example, who use His grace and grow in
it, and by its power transform themselves into the character
which alone can dwell in heaven.&nbsp; Now, all this is
work&mdash;real, anxious, laborious work; this obeying of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, this imitation of His example, and
following in His steps, this putting off of the old man and
putting on of the new man.&nbsp; Are you intent upon it?&nbsp; Do
you perform it?&nbsp; Consider the means of grace, prayer,
praise, divine instruction, holy communion; do you faithfully and
diligently use them?&nbsp; Read the Decalogue <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>with the
commentary of the Sermon on the Mount.&nbsp; Can you honestly
say, All this I keep and do?&nbsp; Study the life of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;is your life like it: like it
in humility, in self-denial, in labour, in fact, in hope, in
aim?&nbsp; Examine yourselves.&nbsp; Are you cleansed from evil
propensities&mdash;are you adorned with Christian
graces&mdash;are you fit in person, in will, in desire, for a
heaven full of holiness, whose employment will be the doing of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> work, as angels do it,
whose relaxation, if I may so speak, will be the contemplation
and the praise of <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; What do
you leave undone, what do you transgress of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> will?&nbsp; What covetousness do
you root out, what evil tempers do you subdue, what rash zeal do
you curb, what indolence do you overcome?&nbsp; Are you worldly,
sensual, ill-natured, proud, self-seeking?&nbsp; Have you any
trace of these stains upon you?&nbsp; Are you wanting in
obedience, in patience, in holiness, in love of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; You cannot enter heaven, it would
close its gates against you, you would flee from it as a place of
torment, while you are in such a state.&nbsp; Now, what are you
doing, or attempting to appropriate <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> salvation, to secure <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> approbation, to qualify
yourselves in character, in taste and desire for a purely
spiritual, a gloriously holy heaven?&nbsp; You know <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>what
concentrated thought, what single aim, what diligent, anxious,
persevering labour are necessary to make you good scholars, able
statesmen, accomplished members of society, successful tradesmen,
apt mechanics; or, to descend lower, ordinary earners of daily
bread.&nbsp; You may guess, then, what measure of these things is
needed to perfect you in saintliness, and therefore you are able
to answer the question&mdash;oh, how must you answer
it?&mdash;whether you fulfil the acknowledged requirement of the
text, &ldquo;I must work the works of Him that sent
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, besides this, so to speak, selfish work, you have a work
to do for and upon others.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span>
Who wills to inform, and persuade, and save the world, appoints
men, appoints you to accomplish His will.&nbsp; Like as <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, besides qualifying Himself to be the
Saviour, had also to proclaim, and recommend, and bestow
salvation, so have you, while putting yourselves in the way of
salvation, and diligently pursuing it, to be lights, and voices,
and helping hands to others.&nbsp; You are lights of the world;
you are ambassadors for <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; you
are your brothers&rsquo; keepers; you are teachers of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> Word, and advocates of His
cause, and treasurers of His gifts; you are under shepherds of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>; you are fellow <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>workers
with Him, and dispensers of His manifold grace.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> has given you these offices, and He has
placed you where you may exercise them.&nbsp; He has given you
authority over your children, and servants, and dependents.&nbsp;
He has lent you influence over friends and associates.&nbsp; He
has planted you in the midst of crowds of ignorant, indifferent,
ungodly, that you may work for Him, in guiding, and persuading,
and leading to salvation, in making manifest His glory.&nbsp; He
has put into your power to contribute something&mdash;into the
power of some to contribute much&mdash;to the various
associations (which are, in fact, your agents), for doing the
work of <span class="smcap">God</span> in building and endowing
additional churches, in providing more clergymen at home, in
sending missionaries to the colonist and the heathen.&nbsp; You
think, perhaps, that in the chief part of what I have said, I
have been describing the clergy, and not the laity.&nbsp; But,
brethren, the clergy are nothing but representatives,
representatives, on the one hand, of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, teaching, exhorting, ministering grace
in His name, by and from Him; representatives, on the other hand,
of your prayers, and praises, and your works.&nbsp; You know
whose would be the blame, and how great the blame, and how
terrible the consequences, if the minister only confessed <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>to <span
class="smcap">God</span> and praised Him, and partook of His
sacraments.&nbsp; It is just the same, if he only teaches, and
exhorts, and visits, and tends, and relieves; an empty sign, a
mockery, a provocation of wrath, which will surely descend on
those who cause it to be unreal, on those who do not make it
real.&nbsp; Ministers we are, coming from <span
class="smcap">God</span> to you, going to <span
class="smcap">God</span> from you.&nbsp; Oh, you cannot suppose
that if you leave two or three clergymen to deal with thousands
of people, to inform them, to persuade them, to become acquainted
with their wants, to relieve them out of their own poor means,
you cannot suppose I say that in so doing, you are working the
works of <span class="smcap">God</span>, that when you have said
your prayers, and listened to the sermon, and paid your pew
rents, and dropped a superfluous coin into the plate of an
occasional collection, you have obeyed and imitated <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; No, brethren, you are under no
such delusion of Satan.&nbsp; An awful responsibility is indeed
upon the clergy.&nbsp; We have sworn to give ourselves wholly to
a work in which your part is to support, and succour, and enable
us.&nbsp; We are pledged to forego opportunities of acquiring
fame, and gaining wealth and power, and taking pleasure.&nbsp; Wo
to us, if we disregard the oath, if we cling to the things which
we profess to have <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>renounced!&nbsp; But if we fail, that will not excuse
you; and if we are faithful without your adherence, the reward
will be ours, the blood guiltily shed, or guiltily unstaunched,
will be upon your heads.&nbsp; It is a solemn theme which I am
discussing this morning, and I dare not but speak plainly upon
it.&nbsp; Our fidelity will not profit you if you are not helpers
of us.&nbsp; Our unfaithfulness, though we perish in it, will be
visited on you, if you do not enable us, if you do not constrain
us, by the power with which you should endow us, by the jealous
concern which you should have for our work, by the diligent
co-operation which you should exercise with us.&nbsp; It is easy
to say, that you are not qualified for this, that your time is
all engaged in your worldly calling, that you cannot spare from
the means of your support, from the capital of your business, the
money which the Church calls for.&nbsp; But, brethren, consider,
that though <span class="smcap">God</span> requires you to
maintain yourselves and your families, though your worldly
callings are appointed for you by <span class="smcap">God</span>,
though He allows you to give much time to them, to advance and
enrich yourselves by them, yet all this is on the condition that
you do not withhold from Him the direct service and offerings
which constitute the one thing needful, the reward of which is
all that <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>shall survive this life, and this world!&nbsp; It was
the fashion once among religionists to despise, to pronounce
unclean (unfitting for the Christian), the use of the world, its
callings, its profits, its pleasures.&nbsp; There is much danger
of an opposite fashion prevailing in our days.&nbsp; The
confining of religious service and worship to the honest,
respectable, intellectual, liberal pursuit of some worldly
vocation, &ldquo;the religion of common life&rdquo; as it is
called, being regarded, not as the companion,&mdash;rather the
handmaid&mdash;but the substitute (and a very good one, too) for
pure spiritual religion.&nbsp; Both are wrong.&nbsp; The
Christian may use the world, and in the right use of it he may be
serving <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; But he must not
abuse it; and he does abuse it, if he allows himself to be
engrossed by it; if he brings himself to a state, if he continues
willingly in a state, where he is obliged to say, &ldquo;I cannot
spare any time or any money, my first thought, and concern, and
provision must be for this life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You have heard, or read, perhaps, that a contented,
conscientious, and cheerful abiding in and following of our
worldly occupations, that even the housemaid&rsquo;s sweeping and
cleaning may be religious worship; and there is truth in the
statement, otherwise the Apostle could not have exhorted <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>;&rdquo; but,
the Scriptural injunction means, &ldquo;Prolong the remembrance
of your spiritual worship: testify your yearning to get back to
it: keep the face shining, when you come down from the glorious
mount, so that while the world demands your bodies, your souls,
your hearts and spirits may still be given to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and even the bodily acts spiritualised
by doing them in submission, in holy observance of the will of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, in thankful use of the means of
support and helps to usefulness, which He thus affords
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Worldly occupations and worldly goods are to
the Christian what meals, and recreations, and sleep are to men
generally: necessaries, supports of the lower life, refreshments,
and invigorators for something better.&nbsp; Give yourselves
wholly to these and you become sensualists, idlers, sluggards;
and give yourselves wholly to the world and you are followers of
Mammon and forsakers of <span class="smcap">God</span>!&nbsp; You
see the right use of the world, as far as this life is concerned,
when the son toils to support an aged parent, when the young man
struggles to get on, that he may establish a home, when the
father seeks through his profession to provide for his family,
when the lover of literature diligently tries to make his calling
afford <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>him money for books and time to read them.&nbsp; This
is employing the world as a necessary means to a desired
end.&nbsp; And so you see the right use of the world, in regard
to a better life, in him who labours and perseveres, and advances
in it with the view of getting as much out of it as he can for
<span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>Be sure that there are none so busy but, in the midst of their
business, they can think of what they like better; none so
pressed for time, but they can spare some of it, if they have a
mind to; none so poor as to have nothing to spend on what they
covet.&nbsp; So use the world, and, in using it, you will work
the works of <span class="smcap">God</span>, because you will
often take from it, and often come out from it, for the direct
and more purely spiritual works of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>But <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, our pattern, said not
merely &ldquo;I must work the works of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&rdquo; but I must do them &ldquo;while
it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We know what that meant in His case.&nbsp; He had taken human
nature in its weakness, and He had to bring it to its full
strength, to fit it for glory and exaltation to the throne of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; He had in His life to speak
the word of <span class="smcap">God</span> to many people, and in
many places, and each opportunity must be seized, or others <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>would be
forfeited.&nbsp; He had to relieve present sufferings, and to
supply present wants; to meet necessities while they were
pressing.&nbsp; Soon the time would come for Him to go to the
Father: then He must be perfect; then He would have no more
opportunity in the flesh for benefitting man and glorifying <span
class="smcap">God</span>; then He could make no more preparation
for the setting up of His Church.</p>
<p>The words have a similar meaning with regard to us; but in our
cases the necessity is more urgent, the delay more awful, because
we have no fixed time allotted us&mdash;&ldquo;to-day, and
to-morrow, and the third day I must be perfected.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Our life is to be taken from us without our consent, and may be
taken at any moment; we have not power to lay it down when we
will, and power to keep it as long as we will.&nbsp; And,
besides, we have not been using each year, each day, each hour,
to the best advantage.&nbsp; We have left undone much which we
ought to have done, we have done much which we ought not to have
done.&nbsp; We have all this to correct, and yet to give full
attention to the works yet remaining.</p>
<p>Look we in at ourselves, brethren, and see what requires to be
done in us before we are fit for heaven.&nbsp; Listen to the
cries of spiritual distress, <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>and consider what has to be
supplied.&nbsp; Think of the souls that are dying, and will soon
be dead, if we do not revive them.&nbsp; Remember we what frail,
short-continuing, dying creatures we are; how soon at the latest,
how suddenly, it may be abruptly, without a moment&rsquo;s
warning, we may be called to present ourselves, to be dealt with
according to our fitness, to give account of our works for <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>Let the arrival of a new year set us reviewing the past year,
with its catalogue of offences, of neglects, of things to be
wiped out, debts to be paid, progress to be quickened.&nbsp; Let
us heed well its injunction and its warning, &ldquo;Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no
work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave whither
thou goest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us look up for the opening clouds
and listen for the Advent voice, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly,
and My reward is with Me to give to every man according as his
works shall be;&rdquo; and let us instantly resolve and instantly
begin to perform our resolution and persevere in it, nor dare to
forget it: &ldquo;I must work the works of Him that sent me,
while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can
work.&rdquo;</p>

126</span>SERMON IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHRIST&rsquo;S TRUEST
MANIFESTATION.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
John</span>, <span class="smcap">xiv</span>., 22.</p>
<p><i>Lord</i>, <i>how is it that Thou wilt manifest Thyself unto
us</i>, <i>and not unto the world</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the festival of the Epiphany,
and on several Sundays afterwards, we commemorate what are called
manifestations of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; revelations
and exhibitions of Him, in His nature, His person, His might, His
wisdom, His various offices.&nbsp; In one sense, <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> whole life, from the manger
in Bethlehem to the Mount of the Ascension, was a
manifestation.&nbsp; It was not possible to see or hear Him,
without becoming convinced&mdash;if open to conviction&mdash;that
He was different from all other men, and superior to them.&nbsp;
His every deed, His every word, His every look, designedly or
undesignedly proclaimed &ldquo;This is <span
class="smcap">God</span> manifest in the flesh!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Still, there were some particular exhibitions of Himself, which,
from <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the
special circumstances attending them, the preparation made for
them, their peculiar importance, their wonderful effects, or
their relations to certain classes or individuals, are entitled
to be distinguished from the rest of that life-long Epiphany, and
to be called <i>par excellence</i> the manifestations of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>
<p>Of this kind, was the exhibition to the shepherds, and again,
that to the wise men of the East&mdash;prefiguring, commencing
the manifestation to the Gentiles; the declaration that He must
be about His Father&rsquo;s business, the baptism by John, the
show of His power in converting water into wine, in cleansing the
leper, in calming the troubled sea, in casting out devils; the
unfolding of His wisdom in speaking parables, the preaching of
judgment by the Son of Man&mdash;all of which are in turn
commemorated at this season.&nbsp; Of this kind, again, were the
teaching on the Mount, all the miracles, the Transfiguration, the
appearances after the Resurrection, the Ascension, the wonders of
Pentecost, the light that shone from heaven on Saul journeying to
Damascus, and the voice that said &ldquo;I am <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> whom thou persecutest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These were all pre-eminent manifestations, as being designedly
full of significance, making special revelations to special
persons; <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>displaying, so to speak, the chief features of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and teaching most important
lessons.&nbsp; Nevertheless, they were rather preludes and signs
of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> truest
manifestation, than that manifestation itself&mdash;faint
glimmers of coming light, rustlings, warning movements, scarcely
upliftings of the curtain that hung between things spiritual and
the would-be spectators of them&mdash;parables, and
prophecies.&nbsp; They left not those who saw them where they
were, but they carried them not whither they would be or should
be.&nbsp; They bade them look and listen; but they revealed not
the sight, nor spake the word.&nbsp; Strange as it may seem,
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> was not truly manifested till
the clouds of heaven hid Him, and, in the flesh, He ceased to
appear and speak till judgment-time.&nbsp; The truth was, as yet,
not taught, but only hinted at, and men were not yet ready for
it, and could not receive it.&nbsp; It is not in what we call the
Gospels, but in the Epistles, that the truth as it is in <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> is revealed.&nbsp; It is not in the
miracles of His earthly ministry, but in the spiritual wonders
which, after Pentecost, the Apostles wrought in His name; that
the real power of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, the power to
bless, is seen and felt.&nbsp; All before was but a type, a
shadow, a dream.&nbsp; The antitype, the reality, the waking
vision, belong to apostolic <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>days, and to the days after
them.&nbsp; Then was the Gospel revealed, which before was only
brought nigh.&nbsp; Then was the kingdom of Heaven opened.&nbsp;
Then did <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, through the Spirit,
begin to speak and show Himself openly and plainly to Jews and
Gentiles, and to draw all men to Him.&nbsp; Then did spiritual
wisdom begin to enlighten, and spiritual power begin to enable
the hitherto blind and helpless.&nbsp; Then first, even to the
Apostles, and then, by them, to the world, began to be displayed
<span class="smcap">God</span> manifest in the flesh.&nbsp; Up to
that time, though He was in the world, the world knew Him
not.&nbsp; He stood among them, but they did not see Him; He
spoke, but they did not hear: yea, though He had come to His own,
they did not receive Him, till the Pentecostal light made all
clear, and the voice of the Spirit declared &ldquo;This is the
beloved Son of the Father,&rdquo; and the power of Divine grace,
enabled and constrained to believe on His name, to receive Him
intelligently and heartily, and through Him, and in a measure
like Him, to become sons of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>Then and thus was <span class="smcap">Christ</span> truly
manifested, as it were in these last times.</p>
<p>But there is even yet a better manifestation, one more really
worthy of the name&mdash;that, namely, <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>which is
made to the Disciples, but not to the world.</p>
<p>In a sense, all that has hitherto been described was an
external manifestation&mdash;a manifestation to the world.&nbsp;
The Gospel was preached openly, the credentials of its heralds
were publicly exhibited, whosoever would might hear and see; and
only when they refused, and judged themselves unworthy of eternal
life, did the Apostles turn away from them, or pass on to another
place, shaking the dust off their feet as a testimony against
them.&nbsp; Even the inward grace, the power to see spiritually,
to believe, and to accept <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, was
so far manifested to the world, that it was offered to all, and
was within the reach of all.&nbsp; The Apostles, who taught men
their need of salvation, and exhorted them to save themselves,
both showed them the way and promised them the grace of
salvation; and thus, therefore, was <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> openly, and with power, manifested to
the world.&nbsp; But, in the chapter of the text, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> makes it a special promise to those
that love Him, that He will manifest Himself to them.&nbsp; Judas
(not Iscariot) rightly concludes that this is a manifestation
which shall be made to none but approved disciples; and,
accepting the promise, he ventures to ask, respecting its <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>fulfilment,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, how is it that Thou wilt
manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that the Jewish notion, a notion
shared by the disciples, was that the <span
class="smcap">Messiah</span> would manifest Himself in all the
pomp and power of a triumphant earthly prince, exhibiting Himself
to the whole world, ruling all the nations of the earth, and
demanding the homage and adoration of all men.&nbsp; They waited
in expectation that the kingdom of Israel would be restored, that
Jerusalem would become the capital of the world, that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> would sit visibly on a splendid
throne, in the midst of her, and that they would occupy the
nearest places to Him of honour and power.&nbsp; This notion was
still theirs, as we know, when <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
led them out to the Mount of the Ascension; and we can well
understand, therefore, that Judas, and those with him, must at
this time have been greatly perplexed by the intimation, which
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> promise conveyed, that
He was only to be manifested to those that love Him.&nbsp; It is
out of this perplexity&mdash;not, as I said before, questioning
the fact of a partial manifestation, but unable to understand it,
and seeking enlightenment&mdash;that Judas asks, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, how is it that <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Thou wilt
manifest Thyself unto us, and not unto the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words translated &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; render possible
a threefold interpretation of this question. 1st. <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, what has happened&mdash;how is it come
to pass that the original design (at least, what we suppose to be
the original design) of an universal manifestation is altered,
and now only a partial manifestation to be afforded?&nbsp; 2ndly.
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, what has been done by us, what
special merits have we, whence is it that we are to be so
signally favoured, and others passed over?&nbsp; 3rdly. <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, what kind of manifestation will that
be which some eyes only shall perceive?&nbsp; In what way wilt
Thou reveal Thy presence to us, so that the world, in the midst
of which we dwell, into the midst of which, therefore, Thou must
come to us, shall not partake with us of the vision.&nbsp; It is
scarcely profitable, perhaps, to consider whether or no the first
interpretation is admissible; nor need we attempt to decide
between the second and the third.&nbsp; Let us rather combine
them; and taking the question out of Judas&rsquo;s mouth, and
adopting it as our own, let us reverently and teachably ask, as
we need, of Him who giveth wisdom liberally, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, how is it, on what account, and in
what way, that Thou wilt manifest <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Thyself unto us, and not unto the
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; On what account is He partial?&nbsp; Why does He make
us to differ?&nbsp; Not then, for any recommendation we had to
His favour&mdash;for we were all concluded under sin, and all
guilty before <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Not again,
for any merits or deserts in His service, for at the best, if we
have done all that He set us to do (and who has?) we are yet but
unprofitable servants.&nbsp; No! there was nothing which should
make <span class="smcap">God</span> respect and choose us before
others; and we have done no work for which we can claim
reward.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> is no respecter of
persons.&nbsp; It is impossible, by any mere natural deeds or
efforts to please Him.&nbsp; We have all sinned and come short of
His glory.&nbsp; We all sin, and deserve wrath every day.&nbsp;
But <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, Who would have all men to
be saved, Who has died for all, and risen again for all, and sent
down His Holy Spirit ready to justify, to sanctify, to bless all,
has nevertheless made the bestowal of His grace
conditional.&nbsp; He requires a certain
&ldquo;receptivity&rdquo; for it.&nbsp; It is not thrust upon
all, willing or unwilling, proud or humble, <span
class="smcap">God</span>-fearing or <span
class="smcap">God</span>-despising.&nbsp; Men must feel their
need of it; and, feeling their need, they must express it, at
least to Him, and must go to Him in His appointed <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>ways to
obtain it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in
sufficiency, in desire, the Saviour of all men, is, in fact,
specially only the Saviour of them that believe&mdash;believe
with that impelling desire, and that active faith, which make
them flee to Him to be saved, and earnestly ask of Him,
&ldquo;What must I do to be saved?&rdquo;&nbsp; And next, having
this fitness, this receptivity for grace, and so receiving it,
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> requires men to treasure up the
grace with reverence and godly fear; to use it with diligence,
with zealous effort, to improve it, to grow in it; to strengthen
it constantly by all appointed means of sustenance and exercise;
to accomplish with it all that He wills and directs to be done;
to be heartily grateful to the Author, the Sustainer, the
Finisher of Salvation.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that hath my commandments,
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and he that loveth Me
shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest Myself to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; So then it is only to love
that the manifestation is made; and love is proved by obedience,
and obedience is the hearty faithful performance, in the spirit
as well as the letter, of the expressed will of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>
<p>And here, brethren, before we go further, let us see in the
light of these conditions, why it is that religious influences
affect so little the vast <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>mass of mankind.&nbsp; There is a
manifestation of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> to the
world.&nbsp; He is ever speaking in their ears and showing
Himself to their eyes.&nbsp; His Church, with its Bible, its
means of grace and ministry, its duration and extension, besides
being a standing miracle, the infallible credential of His divine
authority, the proof of His wisdom and His power, is a very
exhibition of Himself, mighty and eager to save.&nbsp; The
Spirit, which is with and in that Church, declares Himself to be
able and ready to enlighten, and persuade, and strengthen all,
without exception, without delay, if only they will come to
Him.&nbsp; And yet how many, not only of the recklessly profane,
the grossly carnal, the resolutely blind and deaf, but of the
well-disposed, the moral, the albut exemplary, have no perception
whatever of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>!&nbsp; How many
so-called Christians, not only in their business or their
pleasure, when they turn away their eyes from the manifested
<span class="smcap">God</span>, but even when they come up to the
sanctuary, when they read the Bible, when they kneel in prayer or
stand to praise, when they look Zionwards, when they are all
attent, eyes and ears, yet see no sight, and hear no sound of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>!&nbsp; The world which they
have left is remembered, and stands before them in a life-like
picture.&nbsp; The sights they would not see, the <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>sounds they
would not hear, they cannot escape from; but <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, the object of their worship, in some
sense the desire of their eyes, they look for but cannot find; if
He stands in the midst of them, they know it not!</p>
<p>Is not this, brethren, the experience of many of you?&nbsp;
You do not, of course, ever expect open visions, perceptions with
natural eyes and ears of a spiritually manifested Saviour; but do
you not often fail to obtain what you think (and rightly) you
ought to aim at obtaining, a real, though spiritual, a
convincing, constraining, sanctifying, and cheering manifestation
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>?&nbsp; Do you not often, do
you not almost always find just that wanting, which should make
religion real?&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; you exclaim, &ldquo;would
that when I kneel down in church, to make solemn confessions, to
utter supplications, to pray for pardon, for favour, for
grace&mdash;oh! that such a vision of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> were afforded me, that I were
possessed with such feeling of His presence, as would prevent my
turning away so readily from the solemnity, to see who is coming
into church, to admire or criticise the dress or appearance of
those beside me, to remember the worldliness of yesterday, to
anticipate the worldliness of to-morrow.&nbsp; Oh! that when I
sit with open Bible before me, and slight and slur <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>over its
difficult parts, and give little heed to the personal application
of its histories, and treat albut with indifference its
exhortations, its warnings, its promises, its threats&mdash;Oh!
that some voice would recall me from my wandering, and dispel my
irreverence, and concentrate my devout attention with its heard
command, &lsquo;Thus, saith the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>,
Hear what the Spirit saith.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh! that when I go about
the world, and neglect my religious duty here, and transgress it
there, yielding readily to temptation, hankering after, following
worldliness, led by the persuasions, awed by the frowns,
constrained by the demands of the world, oh! that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> would stand at least before my
spiritual vision, and utter to the ears of my soul,
&lsquo;Forbear.&nbsp; Take up thy cross.&nbsp; Follow
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, that He would do all this for others too:
for those whom I love, who go farther out of the way, for the
carnal, for the godless, for the souls that are carelessly, that
are deliberately perishing!&nbsp; Oh! that for His own
honour&rsquo;s sake He would openly show Himself and
dispute&mdash;with the Devil, with Mammon, with Pleasure, with
Folly&mdash;the possession of the souls which He has purchased
for Himself!&nbsp; Why does He not give some proof, why does He
not exercise some persuasion which must be felt, which could not
be <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>disregarded?&nbsp; Oh! that He would rend the heavens
and come down; that He would cheer the saint; that He would
confound and convert the sinner by His manifested
presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is thus, if I mistake not, that we sometimes think and
wish.&nbsp; But, brethren, the words which prompted Judas to
speak, reprove our thoughts.&nbsp; They show us that it is not by
oversight, by defect, by mismanagement, by any failure to
accomplish what was intended, but by deliberate design, by exact
fulfilment of what <span class="smcap">God</span> proposed, that
the real, the strong influences of Christianity are not brought
to bear upon men generally.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Christ</span> manifests not Himself fully
to the world.&nbsp; He never meant to do it.&nbsp; He never will
do it, till he comes to judgment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">God</span>, we are told, &ldquo;will have
mercy on whom He will have mercy, and whom He will He
hardeneth.&rdquo;&nbsp; These awful words do not mean what some
attempt to make out of them&mdash;that there is an arbitrary
election to salvation, and so for all others an inevitable
destruction.&nbsp; They mean rather that while His mercy is ready
to flow, and is always flowing, if you desire it, you must go to
the fountain for it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> is
under no necessity to save all men.&nbsp; We do not confer a
favour on Him by consenting to be saved.&nbsp; His glory will be
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>manifested in destruction as in salvation.&nbsp; He
desires to save us.&nbsp; He will save us, and rejoice in our
salvation, if we seek to be saved: but if we are rebellious, or
indifferent, if we will not comply with the conditions on which
only He will manifest His best presence to us, then we must not
complain, if He makes good His declaration, and proves it by
withholding Himself from us, that whom He wills (and in what way
He wills) on them He has mercy, and all others, though He long
bears with them, and gives them much time and opportunity for
conforming to His will, yet is He content, yea, determined to
leave them in their hardness, to confirm them in their hardness,
because they will not be softened in the way which He has chosen
to prescribe.</p>
<p>Oh! my brethren, do not suppose that it is the weakness, the
impotence of Christianity, the frustration of the will of <span
class="smcap">God</span> that is demonstrated in the
world&rsquo;s ungodliness, in the perdition of so many immortal
souls.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; It is rather the power of Christianity to
keep its own for its own: it is the glorious vindication of the
sovereign will of Jehovah to save whom He will; it is the
corroboration of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> word,
that none should come to the Father but by Him; it is the
terrible, deliberately-inflicted punishment of those that will <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>not come
unto Him that they might have life; it is the manifestation, so
to speak, of His non-manifestation: &ldquo;If ye will not love
me, holding my commandments and keeping them, then you cannot be
loved of My Father, and so cannot be loved of Me, and I will not
manifest myself to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is ourselves, brethren, and not <span
class="smcap">God</span> that must be changed.&nbsp; The seed is
scattered over all the field, but it grows only in the good
ground.&nbsp; If <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is not
manifest to us, it is because we have not complied with the
conditions of manifestation.&nbsp; He is faithful to His promise,
but we have not closed with the promise.&nbsp; Realising, then,
that it is not binding on <span class="smcap">God</span> to save
us&mdash;excepting on the terms which He has Himself laid
down&mdash;and presenting to ourselves the momentous interests at
stake, let us comply with <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
terms, and let us strive to do so gratefully.&nbsp; Let us be at
pains to ascertain <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
will; let us diligently and scrupulously keep it, endeavouring
all the while to follow it, not as mere routine of morality, but
as active direct service of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
Himself, and proposing to ourselves, as the motive to its
observance, gratitude for <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> salvation, and as the reward
of observance, the manifestation of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; So doing, <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>we shall
soon find that there is a real, an unequalled power in
Christianity to attract and constrain us; we shall soon know how
it is that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> will manifest
Himself to His disciples, while He is hidden from the world.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; I have left but little time for the consideration of
the second form of our question, namely, in what way <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> will manifest Himself only to the
chosen.&nbsp; There is no need of a lengthy discussion of this
subject, because, with all our spiritual short-sightedness, we
are not like the Jews, we can have no difficulty in understanding
the possibility of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
manifestation of Himself to whom He will, and at the same time
His hiding of Himself from all others.&nbsp; We know that like as
ghosts are sometimes said to appear to but one of a roomful, so
if it pleased <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;and in any
other way which He pleased&mdash;He could stand visibly at this
moment before any one of us, and utter to that favoured ear
distinctly audible words, while the rest of us saw and heard
nothing of Him.</p>
<p>And there is no use in the discussion of the nature of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> truest manifestation, because
even if the preacher had realised it in all its perfect
blessedness, his words would fail to describe what he had felt;
yea, the best possible description <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>would be wholly unintelligible to
the natural man who perceives not, and cannot perceive, the
things of <span class="smcap">God</span>, while it would be
wholly unnecessary, rather would be solemn trifling with those
who have actually partaken of the blessedness.&nbsp; No,
brethren, it cannot be spoken&mdash;and if it could, I believe,
it might not be&mdash;how <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shows
Himself to those who love Him and keep His commandments.&nbsp; It
is only in its realisation that you can understand what the
promise means: &ldquo;We will come unto Him and make our abode
with Him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Go, fulfil the conditions, and you shall
receive the promise; and it shall disclose to you its own
wonders, and its own transcendent bliss, and its own constraining
power.</p>
<p>But though we may not describe the manifestation itself, we
may observe and recount the effects it produces.&nbsp; The
Israelites might not come up to <span class="smcap">God</span>
and see Him face to face in the Mount, but they were allowed, and
it was good for them, to behold the shining of Moses&rsquo;s face
when he returned from the Divine presence.&nbsp; Doubtless, to
many, it was an additional proof of the being of <span
class="smcap">God</span>; to not a few it may have been an
incentive to seek the blessing of His favour.&nbsp; And so,
brethren, it may be with us.&nbsp; Taking knowledge of those who
have been with <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, we may see <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>on them
some reflection of His glorious self, some marks of a bliss which
we shall covet to share, which may stimulate us both to believe
better in its reality and to strive more earnestly for its
fruition.&nbsp; Yes! and comparing ourselves with them very
humbly, with unceasing prayer and watching against false
confidence, we may even discern on ourselves the faint dawn, the
first streaks of the Divine twilight, which tell (oh! how
unspeakable the bliss!) that the dayspring is about to mount
above our horizon; that the Sun of righteousness is about to
shine into our hearts with all His glory.</p>
<p>Consider, then, such as Abraham, who, after He had seen <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;for <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> was often manifest before the
Incarnation&mdash;could himself resolutely destroy his best
earthly hope if <span class="smcap">God</span> required it; Job,
who, after the vision of perfect holiness, abhorred himself and
repented; Jacob, who felt (and felt throughout his life, we may
be sure) how dreadful, how consecrated was the place where <span
class="smcap">God</span> was met; Joseph, who possessed a power
to resist effectually the sin, which so many dare to say there is
no resisting (&ldquo;How can I do this great wickedness and sin
against <span class="smcap">God</span>?&rdquo;); Daniel, who
entered courageously into a den of lions; Simeon, who longed for
death, and the enjoyment <a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>of the permanent vision, after he
had once seen <span class="smcap">Christ</span>; Stephen, who
died, almost like his Master, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Lord</span> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
receive my spirit;&rdquo; and the many others, who endured and
laboured, and resisted, and persevered, and rejoiced in
tribulation, and hoped against hope, as seeing Him who is
invisible.&nbsp; Yes, brethren, consider these.&nbsp; Think what
they were, men of the same flesh and blood, of like infirmities,
and like sin with yourselves.&nbsp; Think how they secured the
favour of <span class="smcap">God</span>, by the same simple
means which are within the power of the least of you, yea, and
more within your power than theirs, at least of most of them,
because of the clearer light, and the better grace of Gospel
times.&nbsp; Think what a reflection they showed of the visions
of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> which they enjoyed.&nbsp;
Think how real must have been their religious life; how enviable
their peace and bliss; what a glorious light they afforded for
the example and encouragement of other men; and be no longer
content that with all your faculties and opportunities, all your
knowledge and invitations, all your proffers of Divine grace, all
the perpetual revelations of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> to
those who desire Him, you yet should never see Him; but
resolutely accepting His terms, hold and keep His commandments,
and pray, and meditate, and labour to love Him.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Then
plead and watch&mdash;you shall not plead in vain, nor watch very
long&mdash;and the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit will
surely come unto you and make their abode manifestly within you,
cheering you with the light of the Divine countenance,
strengthening you with the strength of Divine grace, moulding you
more and more into the image of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
(which must be yours in perfection before you can partake of His
fullest manifestation), abiding with you here, and shining
clearly even in the deepest darkness, and by and by transplanting
you, perfected in grace and spiritual perception, to the place
where <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is always seen, with an
eye that shall never be dim, with a delight which, however it
grows in desire, shall be more than satisfied, as you behold His
face in righteousness, and are filled to overflowing with the
fulness of His presence.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">BLESSING ACCORDING TO PRAYER.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
Matthew</span>, <span class="smcap">viii</span>., 13.</p>
<p><i>And</i> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> <i>said unto the
centurion</i>, <i>Go thy way</i>; <i>and as thou hast
believed</i>, <i>so be it done unto thee</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must compare the narrative
contained in St. Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel with its parallel in the
7th chapter of St. Luke, to obtain a clear and full idea of the
circumstances which preceded the healing of the centurion&rsquo;s
servant.&nbsp; St. Matthew records just so much of the history as
would illustrate the teaching that the Gentiles from afar should
be received, and many of the children of the kingdom cast out:
St. Luke sets forth in order all the particulars, small and
great, which he had been able to obtain from those who were
eye-witnesses and ministers of the word.</p>
<p>From the harmonised accounts we gather that a certain
centurion, who had renounced the worship of the &ldquo;gods
many,&rdquo; and become a proselyte <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of the gate, hearing of the miracles
of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, sent certain elders of the
Jews to beseech the exercise of His healing power upon a
favourite servant, who was grievously tormented, and at the point
of death.&nbsp; He does not seem to have come at all
himself.&nbsp; The deep sense which he entertained of personal
unworthiness would alone have deterred him; and, besides, he knew
that there was a middle wall of partition between Jews and
Gentiles, and that as yet <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> was
not sent but unto the house of Israel.&nbsp; The elders, come to
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, seek to enlist His sympathy and
active interest, by pleading that the centurion, though not
actually a Jew, was a friend of Jews, and had done much for the
support of the Jewish worship.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is worthy for whom
Thou shouldst do this, for he loveth our nation, and himself hath
built us a synagogue.&nbsp; Come, then, and heal his
servant.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> replies,
&ldquo;I will come and heal him;&rdquo; and straightway sets out
with them.&nbsp; But when He was not far from the house, the
centurion, alarmed at the temerity of his former request, and
shrinking instinctively from One so high and so holy, sent some
of those around him to prevent further condescension and trouble,
on behalf of one so unworthy, and to suggest that <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> should but express His will (which he
felt <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>must be omnipotent) from the spot where He stood:
&ldquo;Say in a word and my servant shall be healed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The centurion had arrived at the knowledge of a great truth,
namely, that <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> power was
not confined to the scene of His bodily presence: and he
described the process of reasoning by which he had arrived at
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am but a man, myself under authority, yet I
have but to say, Go, come, do this, and, lo! it is done by my
servants here, there, or wherever else I appoint, while I remain
still.&nbsp; How much more shalt <i>Thou</i> speak and be obeyed,
Thou who art Absolute and Supreme in authority, Whose will all
the spiritual armies of heaven observe, and are prompt and eager
to perform.&nbsp; &lsquo;Speak the word only, and my servant
shall be healed.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; When <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> heard it, He marvelled and said to
them that followed, &ldquo;Verily, I say unto you, I have not
found so great faith, no, not in Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Twice we
read that our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
marvelled&mdash;once at unbelief, and once at belief.&nbsp; And
this is no mere figurative statement.&nbsp; Our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> literally marvelled.&nbsp; His human
nature, much as He knew of what was in man, was taken aback by
the unexpected and extraordinary display, in the one case of
perverse blindness, in the other of clear spiritual
perception.&nbsp; &ldquo;Verily, I say unto you, I <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>have not
found so great faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is remarkable that our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> selects the centurion&rsquo;s
<i>faith</i> for admiration.&nbsp; He dwells not on his care and
anxiety for his slave, on his general good will and good deeds,
on his consciousness of unworthiness, his resolute humility,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, I am not worthy that thou
shouldst come under my roof.&rdquo;&nbsp; No! it is his faith, to
which <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> gives this highest
praise.&nbsp; That while he walked among His own people, who were
taught of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and was haughtily and
indignantly treated, yea, despised; that while Jews saw and albut
felt His power, and refused to acknowledge it, a Gentile, at a
distance, should be filled with reverential awe of Him, should
assert so confidently the fulness of His power, should have such
an insight into its spiritual working, should find and adduce
proofs of that power and its working, to satisfy himself, to
plead to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;this was,
indeed, worthy of note; this was, as yet, unparalleled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have not found so great faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need not, however, suppose&mdash;in fact we must not
suppose&mdash;that our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> meant to
omit the commendation of the centurion&rsquo;s other good
qualities: rather as they were all the fruits of faith, were they
all praised in the praise of faith.&nbsp; Why did he love the
Jews&mdash;why did he build them a <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>synagogue&mdash;why did he seek
miraculous healing for his servant&mdash;why did he employ Jewish
elders as his intercessors&mdash;why did he, an important Roman
officer, feel unworthy of the company of a wandering Jewish
peasant?&nbsp; Was it not through faith? faith in the true <span
class="smcap">God</span>, faith in the laws of His worship, faith
in His awful holiness, and no less in His merciful goodness,
faith in His manifestation in <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> of
Nazareth?&nbsp; Yes, it was all of faith, and it was all admired
and praised when <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> marvelled and
said, &ldquo;I have not found so great faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
still the highest faith&mdash;the thing most marvelled at and
chiefly commended, was the spiritual perception of a bodily
unseen <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, the belief in His
unlimited, and, under all circumstances, available power.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have never seen Thee: yet I know Thee who Thou
art.&nbsp; Thou art not here, yet with a word Thou canst cause
Thy power to be here, and to accomplish here all Thy
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; Blessed are they that have not seen and yet
have believed: and blessed are they precisely in the way of their
own wise choice, &ldquo;Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so
be it done unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was great honour given to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; It was the opportunity
of a wondrous manifestation, and so we read, &ldquo;The servant
was healed in the selfsame hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>But
shall we suppose that the centurion, by his humility and his
faith, deprived himself of the bliss of receiving <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, <i>therefore</i>, turned away, and
thought no more of him?&nbsp; Even in that case he would not have
been without his reward.&nbsp; The servant, who was dear to him,
was preserved and healed, the Jews, whom he loved, must have
honoured and loved him, when he had thus prevailed with <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and, besides, what a conviction was his
of the power of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, what a token
of approval, in the fact that he had, as it were, proposed his
own conditions for a miracle, and those conditions had been
graciously accepted and fulfilled!&nbsp; He needed no vision
after this to prove to him that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
was the Son of <span class="smcap">God</span>; no voice from
heaven to speak to him comfort and assurance of hope.&nbsp; He
had sought <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; He had found
Him and been found of Him.&nbsp; Great was his reward; and his
joy such as could not be taken away.&nbsp; He would have been
greatly blessed, then, had no more been done for him.&nbsp; But
did that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, Who bestows such
honour on humility, Who so loves them that love Him and His, Who
has made the best of His promises, yea, all of them to faith, did
He, think you, give no further token, no higher blessedness to
that centurion?&nbsp; Did He <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>not rather prove to him, that he had
made a wise choice, that he had chosen the best kind of blessing,
in asking for spiritual presence rather than bodily
presence?&nbsp; Did He not manifest Himself to him, in that
peculiar way of which the world knows, and can know
nothing?&nbsp; Did He not go, He and the Father, and make
spiritual and permanent abode with him?&nbsp; Yes, surely, this
is all implied in the words, &ldquo;Go thy way; and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This view of the subject has its evident lessons and promises
for us.&nbsp; Be it ours, brethren, to learn and practice the
lessons, and doubt not but <span class="smcap">God</span> will
fulfil to us the promises.</p>
<p>In dismissing now the general subject, and attempting only to
deduce practical instruction from the words of the text, I would
ask you to notice first, the kind of answer which prayer gets; it
is blessed in the way it asks to be blessed.&nbsp; When the
elders besought our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> that He would
come and heal the servant, then we read, He went with them.&nbsp;
When presently the centurion, through his friends, urges,
&ldquo;Speak the word only, and my servant shall be
healed,&rdquo; then <span class="smcap">Christ</span> stays His
own progress, and sends on His grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go thy way;
and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>It is
thus that prayer is generally answered: what we ask for, that we
obtain.&nbsp; <i>Generally</i>, I say, yet not always; for our
wise and good <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, when, in our
ignorance, we prefer a wrong or a foolish request, sends us
rather what He knows us to need, than what we ask.&nbsp; A father
does not give his beloved son stone for bread, nor a scorpion
instead of a fish.&nbsp; And it may be, yea, it often is the
case, that we ask <span class="smcap">God</span> for what we
think would support us, or be of some other benefit to us, when
its bestowal would cause us to stumble, or, perhaps, crush our
spiritual strength, or poison our spiritual life.&nbsp; And then,
I say, of His wisdom and goodness, He sends us away <i>not
empty</i>&mdash;oh, no! none ask of <span
class="smcap">God</span> and obtain not, if they ask with right
feeling&mdash;but blessed in a different way from that we
ventured to prescribe.&nbsp; This truth is worth a little more
thought.&nbsp; There are many of you, brethren, I doubt not, who
have again and again prayed to <span class="smcap">God</span>
(and very earnestly) to continue to you some blessing which you
were in danger of losing, or to confer upon you something which
you felt you wanted, and who yet were not answered according to
the prayer.&nbsp; Perhaps, you were failing in business, or your
influence was being diminished, or your health breaking down, or
your child dying.&nbsp; <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Well, you earnestly, humbly, with
faith and strong tears deprecated the calamity again and again;
but still it came upon you as though you had never prayed; or you
asked to be lifted out of your poverty or your misery, to be
endowed with wisdom, to be made influential; you loved, and
prayed <span class="smcap">God</span> to make you loved again;
you struggled to get a situation which was just what you needed,
you prayed continually that you might succeed.&nbsp; It was all
without avail.&nbsp; &ldquo;No answer came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer came!&nbsp; Say not that, brethren.&nbsp; Assuredly,
an answer did come, if you prayed aright.&nbsp; It may be that
you did not get what you wanted, or keep what was departing; for
<span class="smcap">God</span> knew your choice was an unwise
one, and therefore of His love would not grant it.&nbsp; But He
gave you a compensation, and more than a compensation.&nbsp; Just
as when <span class="smcap">Christ</span> prayed that the cup of
His last agony might pass from Him.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> rather strengthened Him from heaven to
endure the agony, and made it His way to glory&mdash;so, when you
have deprecated, or besought, against the will of <span
class="smcap">God</span> choosing for you, He has enabled you to
bear the calamity, to do without the thing coveted, and has made
all to work for your good.&nbsp; What He does it may be you know
<a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>not now,
but you shall know hereafter.&nbsp; And when in heaven&rsquo;s
light you see that the continued or bestowed prosperity would
have made you proud and ungodly, that power or influence (though
you meant it not) would have been perverted by you to your ruin,
that the child taken away, had it remained, would have destroyed
itself, and been a curse to you, that the disappointment, and the
toil, and the suffering, which you so prayed against, were just
the things that planted and nurtured in you Christian graces, and
worked out for your glory&mdash;oh! then you will see that <span
class="smcap">God</span> did answer your prayers, and you will
bless him fervently for sending His own answer instead of the one
you dictated.</p>
<p>Meantime, in the light of this hope, remember always to add to
your prayers for specific blessings the holy proviso,
&ldquo;Nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I said that generally, whenever, that is, there is no harm
to ourselves in what we ask, <span class="smcap">God</span> gives
us what we pray for; and I produced proofs, which might be
multiplied manifold that it is so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go thy way; and
as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Surely this is worth a thought; not only, or chiefly, as showing
us <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> marvellous
condescension and the efficacy <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>of prayer, but as admonishing us
that the height, the amount, the nature of our blessedness,
depends upon ourselves, upon what we ask in prayer.&nbsp; What a
solemn consideration is this!&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> sits upon His heavenly throne, with
listening ear and outstretched hands; angels wait to waft our
supplications to His presence, the Holy Spirit to make
intercession for us, the blessed Son to present our cause and
plead it!&nbsp; It only remains for us to ask.&nbsp; Whatever we
ask, if we are faithful, if it is good, we shall receive.&nbsp;
What we ask not, that we shall not receive.&nbsp; Think of that,
brethren!&nbsp; Call to mind, as far as you can, what kind of
prayers you have been wont to make.&nbsp; Review your past and
present state.&nbsp; In anything are you spiritually
unblessed?&nbsp; Have you only an inferior blessedness?&nbsp; Ah!
have you not all that you prayed for?&nbsp; Lack you not just
that, which you never faithfully sought?&nbsp; This life, and the
things of this life, have been often in your thoughts, and in
your prayers, for yourselves and for others.&nbsp; You have
prayed that <span class="smcap">God</span> would preserve you,
that He would defend you from danger and gross temptation, that
He would give you health, and comfort, and earthly blessing, that
He would protect and prosper those you love.&nbsp; You have not
prayed much for spiritual blessings, or you <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>have been
content with supplicating inferior spiritual blessings.&nbsp; A
clean heart, a renewed mind, lively faith, heavenly peace, joy in
the Holy Ghost,&mdash;if these are not yours, do you not know
why?&nbsp; It is because you never asked for them, or, at least,
never asked with that appreciation, that earnestness which alone
prevails with <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> is willing to give them.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> has promised to give them.&nbsp; He
stands ever ready to fulfil His promise.&nbsp; But, nevertheless,
for these things he will be inquired of.&nbsp; The measure of the
expressed desire is the measure of the supply.&nbsp; Nothing
less, in most cases nothing different, and always nothing more,
may you expect from <span class="smcap">God</span>, than that
which you ask.&nbsp; O let the knowledge of this truth kindle in
you desires, and teach you words wherewith to approach <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Miss not His choicest gifts for
want of asking.&nbsp; Prefer not for yourselves that which is
earthy, and poor, and fleeting.&nbsp; Thrust not away&mdash;and
you do thrust away, if you do not woo&mdash;perfect spiritual
blessedness.&nbsp; When next you kneel before <span
class="smcap">God</span>, whenever henceforth you kneel before
Him, remember that while He is the owner and ready-giver of all
good gifts, it is yet only what you ask that you will receive of
Him.&nbsp; As thou hast believed, so shall it be done unto
thee.</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>But,
secondly, it is faith we see which gives force to prayer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As thou hast believed.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatsoever ye
ask, believing, ye shall receive.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him ask
in faith, nothing wavering.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let not him that
wavereth think that he shall receive anything of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> would have us wait on Him, with
confidence in His sufficiency, with sure expectation that He will
give what we ask.&nbsp; If we lack this confidence and this
expectation; if we make formal, rather than eager and hopeful
requests; if we have any misgivings as to the answer; if we
secretly resolve what we will do, if there is no answer; if we
wait not, and watch not, for the answer, then, brethren, we
forfeit the blessing.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span>
heareth not such&mdash;we virtually ask Him not to answer
us.&nbsp; We mock Him with the idle form of prayer.&nbsp; O ye
who ask <span class="smcap">God</span> for guidance, at the same
time questioning yourselves as to what ye shall do&mdash;ye that
pray against temptation, and forthwith yield to it&mdash;ye that
profess to cast care upon <span class="smcap">God</span>, all the
while being full of cares&mdash;ye that beseech Him to help you,
yet go on helping yourselves&mdash;ye that pray, and live as
though you had not prayed, that call upon <span
class="smcap">God</span>, but wait not for his answer&mdash;ye
that are not certain, that feel not the certainty, and act not,
or forbear from acting upon it, that what you ask <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>you shall
obtain, be sure that you shall go empty away, and that because of
your unbelief.&nbsp; It is hollow formalism, it is fearful
trifling, it is blasphemous mockery, to ask without faith,
without sure calculation upon receiving.&nbsp; You dare not treat
an earthly friend so.&nbsp; You shall not, with impunity, treat
<span class="smcap">God</span> so!&nbsp; Ah! here is the
explanation of unanswered prayer&mdash;prayer for that which is
desirable and right&mdash;it was not offered in faith; the answer
was not expected, and relied on; the life did not manifest
expectation and reliance!&nbsp; Would you indeed receive anything
from <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Prefer your request,
in full acknowledgment of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
ability, in faithful trust in His performance of all that you ask
according to His will, and show your faith by utter renunciation
of all self-guidance and self-dependence, by patient waiting, by
steadfast resistance of all that <span class="smcap">God</span>
forbids, and persevering pursuit of all that He commands.&nbsp;
Impress this upon yourselves as the spirit of your prayer, and
the rule of your lives.&nbsp; Make yourselves such as <span
class="smcap">God</span> hears.&nbsp; Cleanse yourselves by the
power of His grace from sin, that you may be allowed to approach
Him.&nbsp; Arm yourselves with the godly resolution that, come
what will, you will serve the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>;
and seek, above all, His kingdom and the righteousness <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>thereof.&nbsp; Examine yourselves, your peculiar wants
and difficulties, that you may inform your prayers, and make them
pointed and particular, expressing what you need and
desire.&nbsp; Then offer them, with felt unworthiness, with holy
adoration, in the certain conviction that He hears you, that He
can supply your need, that He will supply it; and take to
yourselves such just consolation and assurance, and let your life
manifest them, as if <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, Who
cannot lie and cannot fail, had audibly declared to you,
&ldquo;Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto
thee.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>SERMON XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHRIST STILLING THE STORM.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
Matthew</span>, <span class="smcap">viii</span>., 26.</p>
<p><i>And He saith unto them</i>, <i>Why are ye fearful</i>, <i>O
ye of little faith</i>?&nbsp; <i>Then He arose</i>, <i>and
rebuked the winds and the sea</i>; <i>and there was a great
calm</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was after a day of laborious
teaching, that our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to escape for
a time from the crowds that thronged Him, to obtain rest and
quiet, perhaps to exercise His ministry in other places,
commanded the disciples to steer the ship, in which He had been
teaching, across the sea of Galilee, and to convey Him to the
other side.&nbsp; Immediately, it would appear, that they set
out, He laid Himself down and fell asleep.&nbsp; Partaking of
human nature in its infirmity, though not in its sin, He was worn
out with labour, and absolutely required, yea, hastened to
rest.&nbsp; He sunk into a deep sleep, then, as soon as He
assumed the posture of repose.&nbsp; But anon, a storm
arose.&nbsp; One of those squalls (which so often come down upon
lakes surrounded <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>by mountains) suddenly filled the air with boisterous
wind, and so upraised and agitated the waves, that they dashed
over the ship, and threatened it with destruction.&nbsp; The
disciples, many of whom were fishermen, and others accustomed to
occupy their business upon or beside the water, must have been
too familiar with storms to be easily frightened.&nbsp; The
darkening clouds, the howling wind, the troubled water, would, of
course, arouse them to energy, warning them that they were in
danger, and requiring them to watch and labour to save
themselves; and so we can well imagine them running hither and
thither, with anxious looks, loosing or furling the sails, as
might be necessary; avoiding quicksands, and rocks, and shallow
places; lightening the ship of dangerous burthens; directing
their course by the safest way, to the haven where they would
be.&nbsp; But either they must have been sorry sailors, with
coward hearts, which we are not willing to believe, or their
courage must have been overcome by very unusual and imminent
danger, ere they would have rushed to their Master, and cried to
Him, in terror, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, save us,
we perish!&rdquo; or, in rash reproach, &ldquo;Carest thou not,
that we perish?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I say, there must have
been unusual and imminent danger, <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>and even something more&mdash;some
supernatural portent&mdash;thus to strike with terror, thus to
fill with despair.</p>
<p>However this may be, they cried unto the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, and the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> heard them.&nbsp; He had slept calmly
through the roar of the wind&mdash;yea, even while the waves
washed over Him; but the cry of distress entered quickly into His
ear, and He awoke to answer it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are ye fearful,
O ye of little faith?&rdquo; were His awakening words.&nbsp; This
is not a rebuke for coming to Him; they had done right
therein.&nbsp; He would presently prove it by the miracle He
would work for them.&nbsp; Neither is it an assertion that there
was no real danger, that they had been too easily alarmed: for an
inspired Evangelist, St. Luke, writing long afterwards, in the
light of what <span class="smcap">Christ</span> now said and did,
expressly states that the vessel was filled with water, and that
they were in danger.&nbsp; No; it is an acknowledgment of the
danger, but it is also a pledge that it should be averted, and it
is a tender reproach for not being confident of
deliverance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
faith?&rdquo;&nbsp; Am not I with you?&nbsp; Do not I know your
wants?&nbsp; Have I not power and will to relieve them?&nbsp;
Where is your faith, in the prophecies of what I have yet to do,
that you suppose <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>I am now to perish?&nbsp; Where is the confidence which
becomes my followers?&mdash;which others, with less knowledge and
encouragement, less ground of hope, have so fully shown.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, though
He slay me, yet will I trust in Him!&nbsp; Thus He reproves, and
calms, and assures them in their trouble, and then He proceeds to
deliver them out of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;He arose&rdquo;&mdash;we
read&mdash;&ldquo;and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there
was a great calm.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a wondrous manifestation of
His Majesty.&nbsp; It was a gracious condescension to
infirmity.&nbsp; It was a proof, too palpable to be resisted, too
marvellous to be forgotten, that He is able to keep, and that He
will keep, in safety and in peace, those whose minds are staid on
Him, who commit themselves to His keeping.&nbsp; Well may the
disciples, in the awful stillness of that calm, have been filled
as much with reverential fear as with admiration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
Him?&rdquo;&nbsp; They had witnessed several of His epiphanies:
they had tasted of the water made wine; they had seen the leper
cleansed; and had, at least, heard on reliable testimony, that <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>the
centurion&rsquo;s servant was restored&mdash;yea, in the early
evening of this very day, just before they left the shore, <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> had been casting out evil spirits,
with His word, and had healed all the sick that were brought to
Him: but in their eyes (whether they were right or wrong concerns
us not now) this was a greater miracle, greater in extent,
greater in power, greater in the suddenness, the certainty (felt
by themselves, remember, as no other had been) and the peace and
joy of its effect.&nbsp; Much must it have informed their
worship, much must it have increased their faith.&nbsp; Power did
it give them to proclaim hereafter that they knew in whom they
had believed, patience to endure for His sake, in His strength;
peace in persecution, comfort in sorrow, hope amidst otherwise
confounding terrors and dismay, that they had actually
experienced <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> salvation
from destruction; that the experience had been vouchsafed them as
a pledge of His constant care; that they had been told, on its
account, to trust&mdash;never henceforth to be fearful, and of
little faith!</p>
<p>Of great importance, then, was that miracle of the Stilling of
the Storm, if it meant no more, and accomplished no more than
this: if it only showed, that on a large, as on a small scale,
over <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>elements, as well as over diseases, on the sea no less
than on the land, <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> was
&ldquo;mighty to save&rdquo;; if it only furnished the
eye-witnesses of His ministry with a great instance of His
gracious power; if it only prepared them for their life of storms
and difficulties, and supported them in their dangers and
distresses, and kept them faithful and joyful.</p>
<p>But, surely, it has more meaning, and more worth, than
this.</p>
<p>First, it reveals to us, if I mistake not, a contention
between spiritual powers (the Son of <span
class="smcap">God</span> on the one side, the Devil on the
other), followed by a victory of the good, and a conspicuous
defeat of the evil.&nbsp; That was no accidental raging of wind
and waves, that was no operation of the <span
class="smcap">God</span> of providence using the elements to
accomplish good purposes which was rebuked by the voice of the
Son of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Rebuke would be
meaningless addressed to mere wind and wave: it would be
blasphemous addressed to <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; It
is only when speaking to the Devil, to fevers and distempers, the
effects of demoniacal possession, to Peter or others, prompted by
Satan, speaking his words, doing his work, that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> uses rebuke.&nbsp; Here then, surely,
Satan was at work, and here he was confounded!&nbsp; The enemy of
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>souls
had never ceased to watch and seek to destroy the Saviour.&nbsp;
He had stirred up Herod against Him in His infancy.&nbsp; He had
personally assailed Him in the wilderness.&nbsp; He was now using
the elements, over which much power is often allowed him, as we
see in Job&rsquo;s case, as his agents of evil.&nbsp; But with
all his wisdom and perception, he knew not what was in <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>.&nbsp; He thought once that he could
as easily have made Him sceptical as he did Eve, &ldquo;hath
<span class="smcap">God</span> said,&rdquo; &ldquo;If Thou be the
Son of Man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thought now that while the Son of Man
slept he was unconscious and powerless.&nbsp; And so in his folly
he sought to wreck the vessel, and overwhelm Him whom it carried
in the depths of the sea.&nbsp; Attempting this, he did but give
occasion for an additional manifestation of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> mission and power to destroy
him and his works.&nbsp; On the shore, before He started, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> had cast out devils.&nbsp; On the
shore for which He was making He would again cast them out.&nbsp;
On the sea He now meets them, and confounds them.&nbsp; O what a
mighty, what a galling conquest!&nbsp; Satan had let loose all
the powers of the winds, he had lashed the waves into utmost
fury, the disciples were dismayed, the Saviour was asleep, the
ship was sinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only a few moments,&rdquo;
doubtless, he <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>exultingly thought, &ldquo;and there shall be a second
destruction of man, the kingdom shall surely become mine, for
there will be none to dispute it&rdquo;&mdash;when, lo! the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> arose, and, with a word, made him undo
the work he had done.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peace be still;&rdquo; and the
wind ceased, and there was a great calm!&nbsp; O signal
defeat!&nbsp; O earnest of the promise that the head of the
serpent shall be bruised, that Satan himself shall be bound and
trodden under foot, and cast into the lake of fire, and shall
deceive and vex no more.&nbsp; Surely, this is one of the chief
scenes, one of the most mysterious and important events, one of
the most glorious manifestations of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> life on earth.</p>
<p>But this is not all its significance.&nbsp; The miracles of
our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> were acted
parables&mdash;types of spiritual things&mdash;rather outward
signs, not themselves to be given up, but thereafter to be
accompanied by inward grace.</p>
<p>The ship on the sea of Galilee represents the Christian
Church, or the individual member of it.&nbsp; The sea is the
world; the storm, with its adverse wind and difficult waves,
figures the trials, the buffetings, the persecutions, the fears
of this mortal life; the disciples are the types of weak yet
willing human nature&mdash;both our warnings and our examples;
and <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is Himself, yet, so to <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>speak, but
a figure of the true, dwelling in His Church in each faithful
member, often apparently unheeding, unconscious, yet always our
sure defence and deliverer, prompt to hear when called upon, able
to comfort, mighty to save.</p>
<p>That entry into the ship, and sailing forth into the sea,
represents our first journey, and each renewed journey to <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, in Baptism, in Confirmation, in Holy
Communion, in every fresh repentance, every vow, every act of
worship.&nbsp; Forth we go with Him.&nbsp; All is calm and
hopeful.&nbsp; We seem to have to journey over quiet
waters.&nbsp; The shore of Heaven is straight before us, and we
are making for it.&nbsp; But, as soon as we set out, our envious,
deadly enemy, hating our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, and
hating us, plots our destruction, and assays its
accomplishment.&nbsp; Soon trouble takes the place of peace,
winds of adversity toss and try us, hope begins to pale, terror
to dismay, the waters go even over our soul, and He who should
calm us, and sustain and cheer us, seems to have fallen asleep,
to help us not, to take no notice of us.&nbsp; It is the hour of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> trial, of the
Devil&rsquo;s temptation!&nbsp; What shall we do?&nbsp; If we are
wise sailors, like as I have supposed the disciples to have done,
we shall meet the occasion with well-directed energy; we shall
keep the vessel away <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>from the quicksands of pleasure, the
shallows of pride, the rocks of offence, and the whirlpools of
sin.&nbsp; We shall cast out the weight that drags us down,
sloth, indifference, besetting sin.&nbsp; We shall bear up
against the boisterous winds of adversity.&nbsp; We shall
resolutely and perseveringly pursue the straight course through
the waters, making for, looking for the shore.&nbsp; Unless we do
all this, we have no right to hope.&nbsp; But we must take care,
lest in, ay, even by doing it, we lose our hope.&nbsp; Satan
destroys many because they make no effort to save themselves; but
he destroys quite as many because they rely on their own
efforts.&nbsp; It is a fact that we can do nothing by ourselves;
that human wisdom, self-reliant, is sure to be confounded, and
human effort, independent, to be paralysed.&nbsp; But even if for
the time we see what is right, and are successful in doing it, he
will enshroud us in such horrible darkness, he will fill our ears
with such dismal sounds, he will so toss and bewilder and
overwhelm us, that presently weariness, perplexity, and despair
will cause us to give up, to consent to our own
destruction.&nbsp; The disciples in that storm-tossed ship seem
to have been bringing themselves well nigh into this ruin, first
to have relied on themselves, and then to have despaired of
themselves, all the while forgetting <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Who was with them, Who should have
been their guide, Who was their sure protector, when, all at
once, before it was too late, they remembered and aroused Him,
and called Him to their aid.&nbsp; It was their bliss to find
that &ldquo;the saint&rsquo;s extremity is <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> opportunity;&rdquo; that it is
never too late, before destruction, to call upon Him and be
saved; but they were not allowed to enjoy this bliss unmixed with
reproach for self-confidence and for want of confidence in
Him.&nbsp; In all the storms and dangers which beset us on the
sea of life, let us take example from the disciples to call upon
Him who can save us, and let us also take warning from them, not
to forget His company, or to suppose that He forgets us.</p>
<p>Such seems to be a sketch of the interpretation of the meaning
and instruction for us of this acted parable.</p>
<p>And now, brethren, having learnt the general truth, let us
pick out and dwell upon some of its particulars.</p>
<p>And first, in setting out with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, expect storms and dangers.&nbsp; We
are too apt to suppose that the war of life is to be waged only
with men, that the storms of life are only encountered in
temporal things.&nbsp; We can well understand that it was
otherwise, that it must have been otherwise, <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>with the
first founders of the Church, with confessors in the face of
unbelieving Jews and heathen Romans, with the Reformers, with
missionaries now: but in our own case we calculate on a smooth
and safe journey over the sea of time to the shore of eternity,
ay, and after many days, experience, we say, confirms our
calculation.&nbsp; No sore temptations try us; no conflict of
good and evil principles tosses and tears us; no despair
threatens to drown us.&nbsp; We have trouble enough in the world,
in earning our daily bread, in claiming and maintaining our own,
in becoming rich, or powerful, or famous, in ruling those who
rebel against our just authority, who would gainsay our words,
and frustrate our efforts.&nbsp; But in spiritual things this is
not the case.&nbsp; We find it easy (I speak that which the
manifest lives and apparent feelings of what are called
respectable men justify my speaking) to follow the course which
we would in religion&mdash;we worship in church, we read the
Bible and pray at home without opposition.&nbsp; It costs us no
trouble to keep the letter of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> chief commandments.&nbsp; We
know nothing of spiritual wrestling, spiritual fear, spiritual
despondency.&nbsp; Why should we?&nbsp; Our ways are mainly
upright; our consciences not afraid, our duty plain and simple;
and in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, therefore, our <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>hope
sure.&nbsp; I know that men think this (at least they do not
think otherwise), and in their lives they act it, even if they
dare not shape it into words.&nbsp; But, brethren, if it is so
with you, look to it, for the calm is more deadly than the
storm.&nbsp; The Devil is the inveterate enemy and the untiring
assailant of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> and
Christians.&nbsp; His whole being and energy are concentrated in
the aim and effort to bury the ark of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> in the sea of eternal
destruction.&nbsp; If, then, you pass over that sea, and are
enshrouded by no darkness, beaten by no winds, tossed by no
billows, be sure that it is because <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> is not in your company.&nbsp; That
Church has had its candlestick removed, which dwells in security,
peaceful and prosperous; and that individual has not <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> for the tenant of his heart who
experiences not what the storm-tossed vessel typified.&nbsp;
Satan is intent upon destroying every one that is <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>.&nbsp; If he attempts not
your destruction, it is because he does not consider you <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>&mdash;and, remember, though
he is not all-wise, he is as an angel, and an archangel in
perception&mdash;because your vessel bears not <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; because you are on no journey with
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> to cast out evil spirits and
drive them over steep places into the sea.&nbsp; O, my brethren,
it is an awful sign, a death-boding distinction, <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>when Satan
lets us alone in this sea of life, and deems it unnecessary to
keep us by violent efforts from reaching heaven.&nbsp; It is the
expression of his informed and deliberate judgment that we are
not going thither!&nbsp; O ye who dwell at ease and glide
smoothly along the journey of life, put back, take <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> on board, and joy when you find in
yourselves the signs of His presence, the assaults of Satan, the
warring within you of good and evil, the stirrings of conscience,
the flutterings of spiritual fear.&nbsp; I do not mean become
morbid, and delight in what is mournful and terrible; but suspect
and refuse the peace which Satan offers without contest, and
determine to have only that which in <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> strength you win and
maintain.</p>
<p>Next, consider the meaning of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> lying asleep in the storm,
and interfering not to control it, till so earnestly called
up.</p>
<p>In providence and in grace <span class="smcap">God</span>
delights, so to speak, to hide Himself, though He exhibits the
results of His works.&nbsp; He is the Author of every gift, and
the Ruler and Promoter of its use; but He puts it into our hands
as His agents, and bids us with it accomplish His will.&nbsp; As
the heart is the fountain of the blood which flows through our
members, as it is bone and muscle that give <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>strength to
the arm, so is <span class="smcap">God</span> the Source of grace
to the soul, and the prevailing Power of our efforts.&nbsp;
Still, it is not Himself prominently and foremost that does the
work in the world, but we from and by Him.&nbsp; The explanation
of this economy seems to be, first, that He would have us walk by
faith&mdash;remembering Him, relying on Him, working for
Him&mdash;rather than by right, constrained, whether we will or
not, without feeling or desire, or dependence, to see, and admit,
and feel His power.&nbsp; And, secondly, that He would give us an
individuality, a certain dependent independence, which shall make
us feel personal responsibility, and allow us to deserve (in a
sense) the recompense of personal effort.&nbsp; Thus, He leaves
the fool to say, There is no <span class="smcap">God</span>, and
rewards the faithful by revealing Himself to belief.&nbsp; Thus,
while there is a <span class="smcap">God</span>, while He is not
far from us, while in Him we live and move and have our being, we
are required and stimulated to seek Him, to feel after Him, and
find Him.&nbsp; Besides, or more properly <i>therefore</i>, we
have to call upon Him before He answers.&nbsp; Even when He had
determined, and declared His determination, to bless the
Israelites, He made the condition, &ldquo;Nevertheless, for these
things I will be inquired of.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would have us live
by spiritual <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>dependence.&nbsp; He would have us communicate to Him
our wants.&nbsp; He would have us draw down by prayer the
supply.&nbsp; And this He effects by making it a law, that He
will know nothing of us, at least know nothing so as to heed for
our good, but what we tell Him, and will give us nothing but what
we ask.&nbsp; I have so lately enlarged upon this subject that I
will add nothing upon it now, but to bid you remember the
necessity and the power of prayer.</p>
<p>Lastly, consider what is taught by that remonstrance, spoken
in the interval between awaking and acting, &ldquo;Why are ye
fearful, O ye of little faith?&rdquo;&nbsp; I have already said
that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> did not disapprove the
prayer, but only the fear which had preceded it, the poverty of
the faith which accompanied it.&nbsp; Neither did He demand of
the disciples the impossibility of being undisturbed in the midst
of such perturbation.&nbsp; It is natural&mdash;natural even to
the Christian full of grace, to be affected by the circumstances
which attend him.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was so
affected Himself, as His prayers, and shrinkings, and watchings,
and open teaching assure us.&nbsp; He, who wept at human misery,
though He was just going to put it to flight; He, who shrank from
the trial which He had deliberately and of choice encountered,
has sanctioned and recommended (shall I <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>say
enforced?) by His example the same feelings in His
disciples.&nbsp; He does not forbid us to be human, but only
requires us to leaven humanity with godliness.&nbsp; Trials we
are to have, and trials we ought to feel.&nbsp; To be stolid and
callous is to be unchristian, for none ever felt trials as <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> did.&nbsp; But in our trials, while
we feel, and weep, and shrink, we are not to be
faint-hearted.&nbsp; We are to know in Whom we have
believed.&nbsp; We are, therefore, to bear them, and submit to
them; but we are not to be overpowered by them.&nbsp; We are not
to allow them to exercise such an influence as to make us forget
that there is One greater than the storm, Who rules it even in
its wildest raging, Who will cause it to cease when it is
fitting, Who will not allow it to overwhelm us if we are
dependent on Him in its continuance, if we hope in Him to stay
it.&nbsp; Terrible is the darkness of the sky, powerful is the
violence of the wind, drenching are the waves, but the ship shall
not sink, for <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is in it.&nbsp;
Whatever, then, the terrors and the trouble of the present, we
have hope, we have confidence in the future.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why art
thou so cast down O my soul, and why art thou so disquieted
within me?&nbsp; Hope in <span class="smcap">God</span> for I
shall yet praise Him, Who is the health of my countenance and my
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>Such
is the teaching of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
remonstrance.&nbsp; And the time of its utterance, the delay to
assuage the storm, teaches this further lesson, that in this life
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> will give us comfort in
trouble, but not necessarily deliverance out of trouble.&nbsp; By
and by He will indeed deliver us.&nbsp; But the best blessing
here is not immunity, but trust and support.&nbsp; There is a
peace in war, a joy in sorrow, a strength in weakness, with which
the world and the Devil cannot intermeddle.&nbsp; Seek we this,
and be sure we are wanting in what <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> delights to afford, if we have it
not.&nbsp; But having it, bear we patiently, thankfully, all
outward commotion, faithfully expecting the time, when openly, as
already inwardly, <span class="smcap">Christ</span> shall arise
and command &ldquo;Peace be still,&rdquo; and there shall be a
great and abiding calm.</p>
<h2><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>SERMON XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">UNITY WITH PEACE.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ephesians</span>, <span class="smcap">iv</span>.,
1, 2, 3.</p>
<p><i>I</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>the prisoner of the</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, <i>beseech you that ye walk worthy of
the calling wherewith ye are called</i>, <i>With all lowliness
and meekness</i>, <i>with longsuffering</i>, <i>forbearing one
another in love</i>; <i>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the prayer of our Blessed
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>&mdash;what an earnest prayer it
was, delivered in what solemn and affecting
circumstances&mdash;that all His disciples might be one, even as
He and the Father were one.&nbsp; He had laboured to secure this
oneness, by teaching them that there was the same truth for all
to receive, and the same work for all to do.&nbsp; Individual
fancies and theories were not to be indulged, where the whole
teaching was of <span class="smcap">God</span>; pride was not to
exercise itself where everything was received, and nothing
earned; ambition was checked, by being told that, by seeking, it
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>should
lose, that he who would be first should be last.&nbsp; All were
equal in position, all equal in privileges.&nbsp; In serving one
another, in preferring one another&mdash;by this alone could they
please <span class="smcap">God</span>; in this way only could
they reach unto eminence.&nbsp; Devoted to a common <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, directed by a common revelation,
enabled by a common grace, exercised in a common work, cheered by
a common hope, surrounded with common trials and
difficulties&mdash;what could there be within, without, past,
present, or future, which should prevent them from all thinking
the same thoughts and doing the same works, sinking the
individual in the company, clinging to one another, labouring
together, knit together in a holy bond&mdash;&ldquo;One <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, one faith, one baptism, one <span
class="smcap">God</span> and Father of all, Who is above all, and
through all, and in all.&rdquo;&nbsp; To think for oneself, what
was it but to reject <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
truth; to act independently, but to forsake their appointed work;
not to serve and love the brethren, not to serve and love the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>; to separate from the Christian
company, to go away from <span class="smcap">Christ</span>?</p>
<p>Even if the Spirit had not been given to effect this unity, if
the Gospel had not enforced it by the plainest denunciation of
heresies and schisms&mdash;crimes classed by it with the worst
and lowest, <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>and most certain to exclude from heaven; even if <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> had never prayed for their union, nor
taught them that they were to be united, still, if the disciples
of religion were like the followers of any other cause, it might
have been expected&mdash;it would have seemed morally impossible
that it should be otherwise&mdash;that the remembrance and love
of their Master, the cause which they had taken up, the knowledge
of the way in which alone it could be furthered, their common
relationship, and interests, and aims, and hopes, would have kept
them in one body, would have bound them fast to each other in the
bonds of peace.&nbsp; And, doubtless, it would have been so, but
for the influence and machinations of the evil one.&nbsp; There
could have been no other fruit from such seed, but that the enemy
sowed tares in the same field.&nbsp; In <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, self had been denied and
destroyed.&nbsp; His Church was to be the embodiment and
propagator of self-denial, self-submission, self-devotion.&nbsp;
Such a Church threatened antichrist with certain destruction: for
antichrist is the spirit of self&mdash;and selfishness destroyed,
where would be sin?&nbsp; Therefore, the Devil sought to break up
or mar and impair the Church; and, to accomplish his object,
infused into as many of its members as he could, the very spirit
of self, <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>which it was commissioned to destroy.&nbsp; Alas! he
was too successful in his fell work.&nbsp; Soon self began to
ask, &ldquo;Why should I not choose what to believe&mdash;what to
do?&nbsp; Why should I not make to myself a name, and claim for
myself authority, and power, and reverence?&nbsp; Why should I
not have private views, and seek private ends?&nbsp; Why should I
suffer, and forbear, and seek another&rsquo;s good, rather than
my own?&rdquo;&nbsp; The selfish question was father to the
selfish determination; and so, even in the Apostles&rsquo; time,
the faith was mutilated here and denied there&mdash;there were
heresies, and schisms, and strifes, and boastings of spiritual
gifts, and withholding of temporal substance from <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and indulgence of lusts, and hatings,
and revengings, and backbitings, and fightings, and denying of
one another, among those who were all called with one calling,
enlightened and sanctified by one Spirit, appointed to
&ldquo;keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it has continued to the present
time.&nbsp; There is no such reasoning, and questioning, and
quibbling, and deciding for oneself what to believe, about any
other subject, as about the truth, which <span
class="smcap">God</span> has plainly taught and has clearly
defined.&nbsp; There are no other divisions so numerous, so
lamentable, so strife-begotten, and strife-engendering, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>as in the
one body of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Pride, and
ambition, and self-seeking, in all its worst forms; evil
suspicions, revilings, hatred, persecutions, have abounded, and
do abound, and boldly manifest themselves in that very community
whence self was to be expelled!&nbsp; Many antichrists are in the
world, but as many in the Church.&nbsp; The very heathen repel
our attempts to convert them, by bidding us first agree what to
believe ourselves.&nbsp; The worst of men say they have a right
to despise us for our bitter jealousies and disliking of one
another; and the taunt is common, and has been in some measure
provoked, that religion is only a mask, a cloak to hide
men&rsquo;s basest passions and worst deeds.</p>
<p>It may be urged&mdash;it ought to be urged&mdash;that this is
not altogether the fault of Christians.&nbsp; It was the will of
<span class="smcap">God</span> that the goats should be allowed
to mingle with the sheep, that the tares should not be rooted out
from among the wheat, that the net should contain small as well
as great, worthless as well as good fishes.&nbsp; Hence they are
&ldquo;not all Israel, who are of Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so the
bad feelings and deeds, the things which are an offence and a
reproach in Christendom, are to be charged not altogether to
<span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> true followers, but to
those who only in name are <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>Christians&mdash;to the world, in
fact, intruding into, and mixing itself up with, the Church.</p>
<p>Yes; this is so.&nbsp; The world has sought and found scope in
the Church for the wild exercise of its reason, for profane
speculations, and whimsical fancies; for self-indulgence, too, in
all its forms; for lusts, and strifes, and false accusations, and
enmities, and wickedness, of every hue and measure.&nbsp; The
worst heretics and schismatics, the fiercest persecutors, the
bitterest accusers of the brethren, are evidently not true
followers, even in intention, of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; they are not rebels and traitors,
&ldquo;they are not of us,&rdquo; they belong to the enemy, and
have stolen into our camp; and are now mixing themselves with us,
and confounding, and harassing, and misguiding us, as part of the
subtle warfare which is being waged by Satan against us.&nbsp;
But still, alas! we are not clear.&nbsp; Too many who deserve to
be called something better than nominal Christians, too
many&mdash;ay, even of the best of us&mdash;make no
endeavour&mdash;that is worthy of the name&mdash;to keep the
unity of the Spirit; or, if they strive for unity, forget the
bond of peace.</p>
<p>It is very common to find a man who has been at much pains to
find out for himself the doctrines and requirements of
Christianity, who heartily <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>accepts every article of the creed,
who is scrupulously exact in keeping all the ordinances, who
would think himself guilty of no ordinary sin, if he frequented
the place of worship of another sect, or contributed of his
substance to their cause, who is yet all the while utterly
indifferent to the fact that almost every article of his creed,
and every ordinance of his Church, is ignored, and even denounced
by some one or other of the many bodies of men calling themselves
Christian communities.&nbsp; He thinks it no business of his to
defend the faith, or to vindicate the ordinances.&nbsp; Let every
man look to himself, is his maxim, and leave others alone; or,
perhaps, if he is momentarily interested in the matter, if a wish
springs up that it were otherwise, he soothes himself, and spares
himself further anxiety and labour, by suggesting that Christian
charity would not interfere with another&rsquo;s liberty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These others,&rdquo; he reasons, &ldquo;have a religion,
and follow it.&nbsp; It is not altogether the same as mine, but
it is in many respects like it, perhaps in all essentials.&nbsp;
At any rate, it is better than none; it would be presumptuous to
suppose that they may not be saved by it.&nbsp; Therefore, if I
must help in proselytizing any, it shall not be these mainly
right, but the godless, the followers of no religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Now,
brethren, such a man is utterly in fault: he is incurring the
Apostle&rsquo;s reproach of being carnal, in allowing divisions;
he is offending against the very Christian charity which he
thinks he is exercising; he is unconcerned about the due honour
of <span class="smcap">God</span>; he is disobeying the
injunction to endeavour &ldquo;to keep the unity of the
Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The question is not, whether a man can be
saved in heresy or schism, but whether any Christian, who honours
<span class="smcap">God</span> and loves the brethren, ought to
wink at heresy or schism?&nbsp; And the answer is plain&mdash;he
ought not!&nbsp; Is <span class="smcap">God</span> honoured, is
He pleased, when the creature, to whom He reveals Himself, says,
in effect, Thus much of the Divine account I will accept; the
rest I do not like, cannot reconcile with my private
pre-conceived notions, cannot see to be reasonable, therefore, I
reject it?&nbsp; Is <span class="smcap">God</span> obeyed, when
His servant, instead of fulfilling His whole will, sets aside
capriciously, or for some selfish reason, certain positive
precepts of that will?&nbsp; Is any Christian in a certainly
accepted and safe state, or in the way to it, who does not use,
who ignores the need of, prescribed means of cleansing and
sanctifying?&nbsp; And if he is not, how far is it charitable, to
let him remain as he is, without concern?&nbsp; My brethren, we
all recognise it as the <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>duty of every Christian to promote
the knowledge and acceptance of the truth.&nbsp; Can we be said
to discharge this duty, if we care not about the mutilation or
distortion of the truth?&nbsp; We all acknowledge that we ought
to love one another, to have fervent charity among
ourselves.&nbsp; Is it charitable&mdash;is it not culpably
selfish&mdash;to have, as we believe, the best, if not the only,
right faith&mdash;and not to be concerned that others have it
not?&nbsp; Is it not, too, strangely perverse to admit, that
those in separation are brethren, fellow-pilgrims, fellow-heirs,
to hope to meet them in heaven, and to think, and feel, and live
in perfect harmony with them for ever; and yet here not to be
concerned that we never can give them the right hand of
fellowship&mdash;cannot journey with them, and help, and make for
the inheritance together&mdash;can never even meet them in prayer
and communion&mdash;must let them be as utter strangers?&nbsp; In
earthly matters none of this would be tolerated, could possibly
be.&nbsp; Why, then, can it be&mdash;why is it in religion?&nbsp;
Because we are not jealous enough for the honour of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, because we do not truly love the
brethren, because we do not endeavour to keep the unity of the
Spirit!</p>
<p>But it is possible to err&mdash;there are many who do
err&mdash;on the other side; who, in their zeal for <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>the faith,
insist that all shall think and do precisely as they do, or shall
forego the name of brethren: who have been at no pains to search
out the ground of their own faith, and see how much of it is
derived from <span class="smcap">God</span>, and how much from
man; who make no distinction between important and unimportant
misconceptions; who class together the wilful teacher of error
and the misguided learner, the originators of schism and the
inheritors of it; who blame for their faults those whom they
should rather pity for their misfortune; who would make the path
of orthodoxy as narrow as possible, and excommunicate all whom
they could detect treading on its borders; who not only see
nothing right beyond their own Church, but are impatient of much
that is within it; who split the Church up into parties, and
bring about the worst of schisms&mdash;divisions, misgivings, and
oppositions, among members of the same household, continuing in
the same house; who would have undue prominence given to certain
doctrines; who fight for or against certain ceremonies and
vestments, and certain kinds of music; who are ever looking for
something to protest against, to blame, or to pity, in their
fellow-worshippers or their ministers.&nbsp; These men think that
they do <span class="smcap">God</span> service (for I speak <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>not now of
the wilful); they are intent upon serving Him; but it is like
Saul before his conversion, with an ignorant and persecuting
zeal.&nbsp; They want to establish and keep, what they think, the
unity of the Spirit, but they care not for the bond of
peace.&nbsp; If a member of their own communion does not think as
they do, they quarrel with him, they bid him go, they would
thrust him out: while, as for members of other Christian bodies,
they think worse of them, they speak worse of them, they shun
them more than they would an infidel or a reprobate!&nbsp; Let
not this be thought exaggeration; not always, nor very often, let
us hope, do they come to this growth; but of this kind, alas! too
nearly of this measure there are not a few among both High
Churchmen and Low Churchmen; and in this direction works all zeal
that is not fully enlightened by <span class="smcap">God</span>,
that is not warmed with love for <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and love for those whom <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> died to save and win.&nbsp; Zeal is
good, earnest contention for the faith is imperatively required
of every Christian, but so is right knowledge and love.&nbsp;
Right knowledge, I venture to say, while condemning actual heresy
and schism, would often be content with creeds in general terms,
and would make much easier, than many strict religionists
conceive, the terms of communion, <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>so as to include as many as were
really desirous of being included; and love, Christian love,
would sigh and sorrow over differences, and yearn after
separatists; and would labour, and persuade, and spend, and be
spent, and wrestle in prayer, to cement, to convert, to bring
in.&nbsp; O it is <i>self</i> that is so stern and strict in
defining what is correct theology; it is antichrist in his worst
mood, that would thrust out or cut off a brother sinner!</p>
<p>My brethren, understand clearly that you are most solemnly
bound to accept yourselves, and to urge upon others, the whole
teaching of <span class="smcap">God</span>, nothing less and
nothing more; to render yourselves, to persuade others to render,
precise and perfect obedience.&nbsp; You may not be indifferent
about others, but you must not be overbearing.&nbsp; You are
keepers and helpers of the brethren, but you are not judges and
avengers.&nbsp; It is your duty to honour <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and to maintain His honour; it is your
mission to persuade others to honour Him also.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> is honoured in unity, in agreement, in
faith, in union, in practice, and service, and worship.&nbsp; You
have then to promote this unity; but, as a pre-qualification, you
must have so entered into the mind of the Spirit, as to
know&mdash;specially for <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
missionary work&mdash;what <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>liberty is allowed, and to feel,
after your poor measure, what <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
feels of love for each individual soul.&nbsp; In the prosecution
of your work, the text directs you&mdash;You are called with one
calling, the Gentile is included with the Jew; the aim is union,
not separation, that all may be saved.&nbsp; By all means, save
whom you can.&nbsp; Be lowly, let not self intrude, where <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> should be put forward; be meek, let
not self recoil where <span class="smcap">Christ</span> would
suffer; be patient, enduring, long-suffering, slow to take
offence, determined not to give offence, bent upon returning good
for evil, forbearing one another in love, making every allowance
for wrong training, for natural prejudices, for individual
infirmities&mdash;ay, and even perversities.&nbsp; Be very
zealous for the unity of the Spirit; but be sure that you are
breaking, not promoting, that unity, wherever you sever or
endanger the bond of peace.&nbsp; Follow this advice&mdash;and I
do not say you will root out heresy, and heal divisions, but you
will do much towards it.&nbsp; Argument, and censure, and
ridicule, and remonstrance, and denunciation, and persecution,
have been trying, ever since the Christian era, to establish the
unity of the Spirit, and have rather destroyed it.&nbsp; Try you,
whether he was not enlightened and sanctified by the Spirit, who
said, <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>and acted upon it, &ldquo;that one ounce of love could
do more than many pounds of controversy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men may be
repelled from you, by your orthodoxy, your zeal, your reasoning,
your stout remonstrance.&nbsp; They will be subdued by your
forbearance, and will come after you for your love!</p>
<p>To the best of you, I say, there is some indifference which
you ought to shake off.&nbsp; To the best of you, I say, get
farther from bigotry and the spirit of self.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE LAW IN THE GOSPEL.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">St.
Luke</span>, <span class="smcap">x</span>., 25.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>What shall I do to inherit
eternal life</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have here the question of a
Jewish lawyer, who is said, in propounding it, to have tempted
our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; This does not
necessarily, or even probably, mean, that his object was simply
to ensnare and entangle <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> in his
speech: but rather that he was putting Him to the test, that he
might judge of the qualifications and orthodoxy of the New
Teacher.&nbsp; But, besides this, he seems, from the commendation
presently passed on him, to have had a better motive; to have
been like the scribe who was not far from the kingdom of heaven,
to have felt personal anxiety about salvation, and to have sought
from our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, in an honest, though
somewhat professional and self-sufficient manner, the resolution
of a real doubt.&nbsp; <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>&ldquo;What shall I do to inherit
eternal life?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had listened to the words in which
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> reminded His hearers, that they
had greater privileges than those who lived before them
(&ldquo;Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye
see.&nbsp; For I tell you that many prophets and kings have
desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them,
and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard
them&rdquo;), and rightly concluding that they were an
announcement of the arrival of Gospel times, and the setting
forth of their speaker as the Great Gospel Teacher, he asked,
what was there <i>new</i> for him to hear and learn, and what
consequently remained for him to do, that he might inherit
eternal life.&nbsp; The reply of our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> is remarkable.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
written in the law? how readest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
nothing new, nothing taken away, nothing added or altered.&nbsp;
I come, to fulfil the ceremonial law, to enforce the moral law,
what does that bind upon thee?&nbsp; And he answering said, with
much wisdom&mdash;much spiritual discernment, &ldquo;Thou shalt
love the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy <span
class="smcap">God</span> with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy
neighbour as thyself.&nbsp; And <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt
live:&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, shalt have <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>eternal life.&nbsp; Observe,
throughout this lawyer&rsquo;s speech, how correct is his
theology.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall I do to <i>inherit</i> eternal
life?&rdquo; not to gain, to purchase, to earn it, but to inherit
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not claim it as a profitable servant, I am
not so foolish as to suppose that I can procure it by any
surrender, or exchange, or labour.&nbsp; It comes (to those to
whom it comes at all) as an inheritance, to the children of the
covenant, the heirs of faithful Abraham.&nbsp; And this heirship
is not a natural, but a spiritual one.&nbsp; I am a Jew
outwardly, but I do not therefore claim to be certainly a Jew
inwardly.&nbsp; They are not all Israel who are of Israel.&nbsp;
Abraham&rsquo;s child according to the flesh, I would also be,
what I am not necessarily, what indeed I am not at all of mere
natural birthright, Abraham&rsquo;s child according to the
promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; And next observe, how he seeks to secure
the inheritance.&nbsp; &ldquo;What shall I
<i>do</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Eternal life is not the reward of
service, it is not the fruit of labour, it is the privilege of a
spiritual relationship; but still it cannot be enjoyed by those
who are indifferent about it, or by those who only desire
it.&nbsp; It must be laid hold on by real active efforts; it must
be maintained by a particular course of conduct; salvation must
be worked out.&nbsp; &ldquo;What must I do&rdquo; to secure
it?&nbsp; Truly he is an <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>enlightened scribe!&nbsp; He knows
that eternal life is the free gift of a <span
class="smcap">God</span>, Who is no respecter of persons; Who
recognises no birthright, no personal merits; Who will have mercy
on Whom He will have mercy: but that yet grace does not fall, as
the rain from heaven, alike upon the barren and the fertile, the
thankless and the thankful, the careless and the anxious, the
indolent and the active; but is ever guided by a discerning and
distinguishing hand, is ever bestowed upon righteousness.&nbsp;
And so he asks, What is the righteousness that inherits grace:
knowing well what was the prescribed righteousness of the law,
how men were to be saved in times past; but expecting that under
the Gospel, an additional, perhaps a different course was to be
followed.</p>
<p>We have already seen that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
referred him back to the law, as revealing and enacting all that
was necessary.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is written in the law?&nbsp; How
readest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in his answer to this question
that we see chiefly the perfection of his religious theory and
his great intellectual superiority to the scribes
generally.&nbsp; For, observe, he does not reply &ldquo;We must
be circumcised; we must be sprinkled with the blood of goats and
heifers; we must keep the Passover; we must wait on the
temple-services; we must give tithes <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>of all that we possess.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nor, again, does he say, &ldquo;We must observe all moral
precepts; we must refrain from all idolatry; we must do justice
and love mercy; obeying implicitly the commandments of the two
tables.&rdquo;&nbsp; No! in theory he is wiser than that: he has
no reliance on external rights and ceremonies: he is sure that
<span class="smcap">God</span> demands something better than a
servile conformity with certain precepts and restrictions.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">God</span>, he knows, looks to the heart,
requires the spirit rather than, <i>i.e.</i>, beyond the
letter.&nbsp; The law has taught him this: Moses gave him from
heaven ceremonies to perform, and moral commandments to keep; but
Moses told him, that mere outward conformity with these things
was not righteousness; that the law was spiritual; that the acts
done and refrained from under it were only exhibitions of a
principle which must reign within: &ldquo;Thou shalt love the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy <span
class="smcap">God</span> with all thy heart and with all thy
soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy
neighbour as thyself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even so, &ldquo;Thou hast
answered right,&rdquo; said <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast learnt under
the law, all that the Gospel would teach.&nbsp; To exhibit this
is the bent of My life on earth, to enforce it will be the
mission of My Church.&nbsp; Love is the fulfilling of the
law.&nbsp; This do, and thou shalt live.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>It
appears to me, brethren, that in this conversation, carefully
considered, we may find a clue to the satisfactory interpretation
of those perplexing sayings about the differences between the law
and the Gospel: &ldquo;The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are not under the law,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the ministration of condemnation;&rdquo; &ldquo;The
covenant that was confirmed before of <span
class="smcap">God</span> in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
the law which was 430 years after cannot disannul.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Law and the Prophets were until John.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not come to destroy the law.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This
do and thou shalt live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a common notion that there is an essential difference,
amounting even to a contradiction between the law and the
Gospel.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> is supposed&mdash;as
if He were an imperfect Being changing His ways
capriciously&mdash;to have suspended the Covenant of Grace which
He had made with Abraham, from the time of Moses to that of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and to have given the Jews in its
stead a Covenant of Works, which He well knew they could not
keep, and under which, therefore, they were sure to be destroyed:
or, if He accepted any of them under the law, then, it is said,
that inasmuch as their obedience was of course imperfect, He must
have been content with less than He had required, and have
disregarded His own <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>decree, &ldquo;The soul that sinneth
it shall die.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, more than this: that He dispensed
for a time with the merits of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> atonement and the finding of
salvation through Him, and dealt with man on his own merits, and
rewarded him for an imperfect obedience.&nbsp; But now, it is
urged, all this is once more changed.&nbsp; The law, having
served its purpose of showing men that they could not obey <span
class="smcap">God</span> in the letter, having concluded them all
under sin by disallowing the things they were prone to, and
requiring what they could not do, having disappointed and balked
them in their efforts to obtain salvation by it, and so caused
them to abandon its observance in despair, and to inquire for
another way of salvation&mdash;thus being a schoolmaster to lead
them to <span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;has now been
wholly repealed; so that we have nothing more to do with it,
being brought out of bondage into liberty, and what we find
forbidden or required by it, is not forbidden or required by us
<i>because it is in the law</i>, but may be done or left undone,
notwithstanding what the law says, unless some eternally moral
principle, independent of Jewish sanctions and restrictions,
would be thereby violated!&nbsp; I have put this in plainer and
stronger words than any of yourselves probably would use, or are
accustomed to hear: but I have not exaggerated <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>the
matter.&nbsp; In proof, let me ask, Are there not many who think
the rehearsal of the Decalogue out of place in the Communion
service? who object to moral preaching as savouring of the
obsolete law? who talk about the &ldquo;filthy rags&rdquo; of
their own righteousness, as if they were something wrong in
keeping in the law? who believe that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> is glorified most when they do least?
who boast of a liberty to use or use not ordinances and means of
grace? who reproach others with being, for instance,
Sabbatarians? who speak of the <span class="smcap">God</span> of
the New Testament almost as if the <span class="smcap">God</span>
of the Old Testament were another Being, of different attributes,
enacting different laws?&nbsp; And even among those who have not
distinctly set the law and the Gospel in opposition, is there not
a vague notion that somehow the Old Testament does not concern us
Christians, and that our way of salvation is different from that
of the Jews, and much easier to follow?&nbsp; O how do such
persons reconcile with their notions <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> teaching of the lawyer, whom
He not only told to look for the way of salvation in the law, but
commended for finding it there, and enjoined to keep it as the
condition of salvation: &ldquo;This do, and thou shalt
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact is, the way of salvation has always <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>been the
same, since man became a sinner.&nbsp; Eternal life has always
been a free gift in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Not
for their merits or deservings does <span
class="smcap">God</span> love men; not by their own inventions or
labours do they procure acceptance.&nbsp; The precious blood of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> shed (in effect) before the
foundation of the world, has ever been the fountain for sin; the
intercession of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> has ever been
the means of reconciliation; the grace of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> sanctified human nature
applied by the Holy Spirit has ever been the leaven of
regeneration, of conversion, of perfection in holiness and
fitness for the inheritance of the saints in light.&nbsp; But
<span class="smcap">God</span> has never been indifferent to the
way in which men receive His free gifts.&nbsp; He at first
created man for His own glory, and He has redeemed, and would
sanctify him for His glory.&nbsp; He made man to love Him, to
depend on Him, to render Him the grateful homage of a free-will
service, to reflect His own glorious attributes of holiness and
love.&nbsp; The sin of Adam and Eve was not that they ate of a
particular fruit reserved from them, but that they frustrated the
end for which they were created; that they found not their
delight in the way of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>
will; that they chose for themselves out of Him; that they
doubted His truth, gave themselves over to the influence and
dominion <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>of another lord.&nbsp; They would have sinned as
greatly, as hatefully, had they scrupulously refrained from the
deed of sin, but in their hearts longed after it, and in their
hearts murmured against the restriction, and disputed the
importance or the justice of it.&nbsp; And so the holiness of
pardoned man does not consist in the mere mechanical, servile, or
selfish rendering of outward obedience, in the number of enjoined
things which he does, and the number of forbidden things which he
avoids; but in the inward love and gratitude which he feels
towards <span class="smcap">God</span>, in his filial reverence
of his Heavenly Father, in his delight to carry out <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> known will, and his anxiety to
learn more, that he may do more of it, in his heart&rsquo;s
beating, so to speak, in unison with <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> heart, and his life&rsquo;s
reflecting <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> light and
love.</p>
<p>To bring men to this state, that He may delight in them, that
they may glorify Him in all things, is the purpose and aim of
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> great scheme of salvation;
and, to forward that scheme, is, and has been, the object of all
His dealings with men of all times (when they have not been
judgments of wrath, because mercy was refused), whether they have
been encouragements or remonstrances, pleadings or rebukes,
blessings or chastisements, the promulgations of moral laws, the
laying on or <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>taking off of positive or ceremonial
commandments.&nbsp; None of these things could in themselves have
made men what <span class="smcap">God</span> willed them to be,
loving children of a loving Father; yet they had, or were
designed to have, their effect in bringing them back little by
little to a right mind, and a right life.&nbsp; But being used by
a wise and discerning <span class="smcap">God</span>, though
their object was always uniform, the use of them has varied, one
being employed in this case, another in that, according to the
state of those on whom they were to operate.&nbsp; Thus Adam,
fresh from the hand of <span class="smcap">God</span>, full of
knowledge and intelligence, and holiness and love, was left, it
would appear&mdash;but with one commandment, the test of his
integrity&mdash;to worship and glorify <span
class="smcap">God</span> as his own heart and mind dictated;
while the Jews, coming out of Egypt, sunk in ignorance, given to
idolatry, perverse in will and affections, were dealt with as
babes, albut without mind and without heart.&nbsp; To them it was
necessary to declare, that there was but one <span
class="smcap">God</span>, to command them to worship Him, to
prescribe every particular of the worship, to bid them not
blaspheme Him, to hedge them in by numerous restrictions, to
write down every item of their duty, to encourage their obedience
by immediate rewards, to check their transgressions by instant <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>punishments!&nbsp; They were treated, in fact, just as
wise and fond parents treat little children: their minds taught
by pictures&mdash;brazen serpents, pillars of light and fire,
gorgeous tabernacles, sacrifices of bulls, and goats, and lambs,
burnings of incense, and the like&mdash;and their hearts and
lives trained by a course of discipline suited to their
comprehension, and a system of rewards and punishments which they
could appreciate.&nbsp; These things were means to an end.&nbsp;
They impressed upon the Jews, that reverence and obedience were
due to <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; They taught them to
look to Him for reward and punishment, to love and fear
Him.&nbsp; But like the arbitrary discipline we use with
children, and the toys which we give or take away from them
according to their conduct, they were to be set aside (as far as
they were childish) so soon as more intelligent and better
influences could be employed, and the children be taught to use
their minds and hearts, in exercising reverence, and love, and
fear, not in little observances and restrictions, not in mere
literal compliance with some particular expressed laws, but
according to the principle of love which would devote itself
entirely, and which uses all its powers to find out what is
devotion, and to practice it.</p>
<p>Thus, I say, the Jews were dealt with from <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>Moses to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and then men were bidden to
put away childish things&mdash;the Spirit being given to raise
them above childishness&mdash;and henceforth to render enlarged,
enlightened, loving service to <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; They were not released from
reverence and submission: very few commandments hitherto observed
were repealed, save those that were typical and ceremonial, and
which, of course, gave way to the antitype and to the new ritual
of Christianity; but henceforth, they were told, <span
class="smcap">God</span> would not be pleased with mere literal
obedience: Do what you did before, but do it in the spirit, and
carry it farther, and search about to see whether your own hearts
and minds cannot regulate your lives in things not
prescribed.</p>
<p>Indeed, all this had been told them before, as the quotation
of the lawyer from Deuteronomy alone would suffice to show; but
it was not so strictly required of them as it is of us, because
allowance was made for their childish want of spiritual
comprehension, and because the perfection of obedience was
postponed till the full strength was given to render it, as well
as the enlightened mind to understand it.</p>
<p>In Gospel times the law is spiritualised, the observance of
the commandments is extended beyond the outward life, to the very
thoughts and <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>desires.&nbsp; To covet is to steal, to lust is to
commit adultery, to hate is to murder!&nbsp; Hence, while in one
sense, our obedience is easier, because we render it under the
influence of enlightened minds and kindled feelings, of love and
gratitude&mdash;whereas, the Jew was perpetually crossing and
driving himself to keep a law which had no other recommendation
to him than that its observance preserved him from immediate
chastisement&mdash;in other respects, our obedience is not only
more imperatively necessary, because our privileges and
responsibilities are greater, but it must be more precise,
because any wilful deviation from it&mdash;in us who are of a
mature and enlightened age&mdash;will surely indicate an unloving
heart; and he that has no love has no spiritual life!</p>
<p>This, after all, is the distinction between the good works of
the Jew and those of the Christian; not that the former sought
salvation on account of them, while the latter makes them but the
tribute of praise and love for salvation&mdash;for the Jew
believed that he was saved by ordinances, not by works&mdash;but
that the Jew&rsquo;s was the enforced obedience of slavish fear,
while the Christian&rsquo;s is the spontaneous expression of
filial love.&nbsp; If the Christian were perfect in moral
perception, he would be a law to himself, and would need but <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>little of a
written law; but not being thus perfect, he finds his greatest
help to glorify <span class="smcap">God</span>, in the studying
and following of the Mosaic laws, which are samples and specimens
furnished by <span class="smcap">God</span>, of acceptable works,
and which, moreover, are a standard whereby he may measure, not
so much how near, as how far he is, from doing the whole will of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>This purpose, then, the law serves to Christians: it points
out the ways in which love should exercise itself; and so, by
confronting the negligent or transgressing, proves to them the
absence or the imperfection of their love.&nbsp; The Christian is
not free from the observance of one jot or one tittle of it,
though he is no longer under the law, but under grace; but even
if he has kept it all, he is not necessarily accepted: he has not
rendered service pleasing to <span class="smcap">God</span>, if
his will is not better than his power, his heart larger than his
deeds!&nbsp; This the lawyer knew theoretically; and yet, against
his knowledge, he sinned.&nbsp; When asked what the law required
him to do, he answered rightly, that the law required, above and
beyond particular deeds, an impelling principle of love for <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and, for His sake, for man also.&nbsp;
But then, when his answer was commended, we are told that he,
willing to justify himself (which <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>means, either to excuse himself for
past imperfection, or to attain presently unto the condition of
the just, without becoming all that was required of him)
demanded, &ldquo;And who is my neighbour?&rdquo; showing thereby,
how much his heart was behind his mind; betraying the fact, that
while he professed entire devotion to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, he was really trying to find out with
how stinted and formal an obedience, he could win and keep his
favour.</p>
<p>In review of this history, let me suggest to you, in very few
words, some important truths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do to inherit eternal life?&rdquo; is a
momentous question for each of you to ask of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, through His revealed word.&nbsp; For
the inheritance never shall be yours, unless you observe the
conditions upon which it was promised; and one of those
conditions (a most important one), is, that you should pursue
constantly a course of righteousness, both to glorify <span
class="smcap">God</span> by prescribed service, and to acquire by
spiritual exercise the necessary character for heaven, without
which none can enter it.</p>
<p>To do righteousness&mdash;not simply to feel, or think, or
speak righteously&mdash;is what is plainly enjoined upon
you.&nbsp; Still, you must remember that you are not to propose
to yourselves, as the approved course, the observance only of
particular <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>laws, the confining of religion to special times, and
places, and objects, and deeds; the mere walking in a clearly
marked out path, as though hands, and feet, and ears, and lips,
without heart or mind, could work out salvation; as though, too,
it were not practicable or desirable, that you should offer unto
<span class="smcap">God</span> any free-will service, something
besides what He has asked you to do!&nbsp; Above all, having come
to understand, that while the fruit of religion is in the life,
the germ of it is in the heart; that without faith, and hope, and
love, it is impossible to please <span class="smcap">God</span>;
that the law to you is spiritualised; that you are brought out of
the bondage of servants into the glorious liberty of sons; that
not the mere letter of the law, but the spirit of it is to be
your guide; that outward deeds are not of themselves acceptable
to <span class="smcap">God</span>, but only as signs of
enlightened hearty feeling&mdash;things done in faith and love;
that worship in the temple is nothing, unless you worship out of
the temple likewise; that bowing the knee, and praising with the
lips, are an abomination, unless the spirit, too, is bowed and
the soul upraised; that bodily sacrifice alone is no sacrifice,
that it needs the broken and contrite heart, and the devoted
spirit&mdash;while understanding, I say, all this, and rejoicing
in the <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>reasonable, heart-sprung, spiritual service of the
Christian, beware lest you separate what <span
class="smcap">God</span> has joined, or substitute free-will for
commanded service, using your liberty otherwise than as servants
of <span class="smcap">God</span>; carrying out, as you suppose,
the spirit of the law wholly in your own way, instead of keeping,
while you spiritualise the letter of the law.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
time is come when, neither in Jerusalem nor in this mountain,
shall ye worship the Father,&rdquo; does not mean that appointed
places of worship shall not be resorted to, but that, besides,
<span class="smcap">God</span> shall be worshipped
everywhere.&nbsp; A yearly celebration of the Passover is no
longer necessary; but a continual feast is substituted for
it.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> seeks now to be
worshipped in spirit and truth&mdash;that is, not without the
body, but in addition to the body, with the spirit.&nbsp; The
letter by itself killeth, because it is formal, and leaves the
noblest powers and feelings of man unengaged for <span
class="smcap">God</span>; but the letter, as the carrying out of
the Spirit, is still so imperative, so vital, that he who does
not observe it foregoes the promise, &ldquo;This do, and thou
shalt live!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PRESENT SALVATION.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">II. <span
class="smcap">Corinthians</span>, <span class="smcap">vi</span>.,
2.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Behold</i>, <i>now is the day of
salvation</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Paul</span>, having just quoted a
prophecy of Isaiah, which relates to an accepted time and a day
of salvation, in the text declares the fulfilment of that
prophecy: &ldquo;Now is the accepted time; now is the day of
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; That which was then promised, is now
performed; that which was formerly but anticipated, and only
embraced by faith, while yet afar off, is now realised and
brought near.&nbsp; But the prophecy itself was mentioned by the
Apostle, to enforce an entreaty, &ldquo;We then as workers
together with Him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace
of <span class="smcap">God</span> in vain.&nbsp; For He saith, I
have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation
have I succoured thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is evident, then, that <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>St. Paul
would impress upon the Corinthians that men are in danger of
receiving the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> in vain, of
not benefitting by all the merciful and bountiful provision made
through <span class="smcap">Christ</span> for their redemption,
and justification, and sanctification, by not recognising that
this is the day of salvation, and so, not looking and preparing
for, and receiving a present salvation.</p>
<p>Salvation is, as you know, the result&mdash;possible in all
cases; certain, wherever the conditions are observed&mdash;of
redemption by <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; In its
perfection, it is absolute freedom from the guilt, the taint, and
the power of sin, and complete, effectual, and abiding holiness
of heart and life.&nbsp; It belongs not to our proposed subject
to consider at any length the destruction from which this is a
salvation, nor the manner in which it was wrought out for lost
sinners by <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, nor the blessedness
of its perfect possession and fruition, which can only be had in
heaven.&nbsp; We have rather to do with what is present, than
with the past and the future.&nbsp; We inquire not now, What has
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> done, or, What shall we reach
by and by, but, What ought we to do now?&nbsp; What have we, or
may we have now?&nbsp; In what respects, to what extent, is
salvation a thing of the present?</p>
<p>First, then, it is present in the offer to bestow <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>it, and the
exhortations and influences to lay hold on it.&nbsp; When <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> rose victorious from the tomb, having
paid the ransom for all the prisoners of the law, and purchased
the right and power of being their Saviour, He did not
immediately make all the men of His time actual partakers of the
privileges, nor did He provide that all who should thereafter be
born, should from their birth inherit the blessing, as from Adam
they had inherited the curse.&nbsp; No man might say,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Christ</span> has died and risen
again, therefore, I am certainly saved, without any reserve or
delay on His part, without any effort, almost without any desire,
on my part.&rdquo;&nbsp; Salvation was then provided; rather, the
fountain was then opened, and began to flow; but each man in his
turn, at the call of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and in the
way of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> appointment, was,
so to speak, to help himself to salvation.&nbsp; In other words,
what <span class="smcap">Christ</span> did, was not to take all
who were then living into an ark, and to cause all that sprung
from them to be born and brought up in that ark; but simply to
build an ark, and leave it open for all ages, and to offer helps
to reach it, and to urge an entrance into it upon all men, by the
entreaties and promises of His love, and the threats of His
wrath.</p>
<p>We want to be impressed with this.&nbsp; We are <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>too apt to
look upon salvation as an accomplished fact, belonging to the
past; to speak of the blessedness of being born after the
atonement has been made; to take for granted that we are actually
saved, rather than that we have a present offer of salvation; and
even to regard the ordinances of religion, as Baptism and Holy
Communion, more as ceremonies of thankful faith, acknowledgments
of obligation for past favours, than as means of laying hold on a
now offered, and, as yet, unattained blessing.</p>
<p>Think a moment, brethren: look into your ways and thoughts
about religion, and you will, perhaps, find that it is so with
you; that, whatever may be your theory, your practice does not
assent to the truth, that &ldquo;Now is the day of
salvation&rdquo;; that you have now to be saved, yet to be washed
from sin, to have its power destroyed in you, to be qualified for
salvation, to lay hold on it, to work it out with fear and
trembling, as that which, though commenced, is not certain to be
completed&mdash;which, even when got, may again be lost.&nbsp; It
may occur to you, as an objection to this statement, that you use
means of grace, and somewhat diligently; that you exercise
yourselves in prayer, and by Christian discipline; that you
depend continually upon the ever-present grace of <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span><span
class="smcap">God</span>; that you count not yourselves to have
attained; that you seek to go on unto perfection.&nbsp; All this
may be true, and yet&mdash;I beseech you ask yourselves whether
it is not so with you&mdash;the latent feeling may be, that
salvation is a thing inherited, already, in a measure, attained;
and that what religion requires of you, and what you render, is
gratitude to the Giver, and a due appreciation of the gift,
sought to be testified and developed by a becoming life, and an
enlarging of the spiritual faculties, which by and by will have
so much more to exercise themselves upon.</p>
<p>But, secondly, is not this, it may be urged, a right view and
feeling?&nbsp; Is not this what the ministers of religion should
labour to impress upon the baptized: that they have received
salvation&mdash;the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
which bringeth salvation?&nbsp; Are we not taught by the Church,
and by the Bible, that in baptism we were born again, that we
then became children of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;and
if children, then heirs, joint heirs with <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; that we are, therefore, from that
new birth as actually the inheritors of a blessing, as naturally
we were inheritors of a curse; and that, thenceforth, it is
proper for us to say, &ldquo;I heartily thank my Heavenly Father
that he hath called me to this state of salvation through <span
class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>&rdquo;?&nbsp; It is even <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>so,
brethren.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now is the day of salvation,&rdquo; may
mean to us Christians, &ldquo;now we <i>have</i>
salvation,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;now it is only offered to
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be intended to stir us up to a
consideration of our high calling, to an appreciation of the
great gift already bestowed, to a remembrance of what <span
class="smcap">God</span> has already done for us, to a sense of
His abiding presence.&nbsp; There is no doubt&mdash;whether this
text teaches it or no is another question&mdash;that the
disciples of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> have a present
possession, as well as a present offer of salvation; and what I
meant in the first part, was not to hide this truth, but to guard
against the error, to correct whatever amount you might have of
the feeling, that we have already a final gift, so complete that
nothing can be added to it, so altogether of the past, that we
can do nothing in the present, but acknowledge the goodness of
<span class="smcap">God</span> in bestowing it, and wait on Him
patiently and holily till He is pleased to reveal to us the full
excellencies of the gift, and to enable us to enjoy them in the
eternal heaven.&nbsp; Above all, I meant to protest against, to
awaken from the fearful delusion, that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> has conferred absolutely on mankind,
or upon any chosen number&mdash;the elect&mdash;the salvation
which, by His precious merits, He procured; that it is ours
independently <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>of means of grace, without closing with present offers
of it, and making present exertions, and showing present
appreciation of it; that it can be ours at all, without earnest
seeking and praying for it, and strivings, and workings, and
self-denials, and crucifyings of evil, and growth in grace, and
perseverance unto the end.&nbsp; &ldquo;By grace are ye saved,
and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Work out your own
salvation, each individual of you; make that your own which was
once procured for all that would have it; work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.&nbsp; Your salvation (I speak
to the baptized) is <i>begun</i>, you have <i>present</i>
salvation&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, you are in the way which leads to
salvation.&nbsp; You have guaranteed to you, on conditions, the
helps necessary to attain perfect salvation.&nbsp; You may
derive, and should be deriving, present benefits from your
salvation, and you should experience present joy in it.</p>
<p>You have, I say, present salvation.&nbsp; You have been made
members of that One Body, which was sanctified, and which is able
to sanctify all other bodies that are joined to it: you are
branches of that glorious tree, whose sap, pervading every
healthy branch, gives it present strength and develops its
beautiful growth, and by and by will <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>produce the fruit of everlasting
life.&nbsp; You have the life of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> kindled in your souls.&nbsp; Your
bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Now is the day of
salvation, and <i>present</i> salvation, too; not merely past
salvation applied, not that you are washed in a lake whose waters
<i>once</i> flowed from a glorious Fountain; not that you partake
of a store of sanctification, long ago laid up; but that now each
individual of you is operated upon by a present influence,
deriving directly from the source, the water of life, having
sanctification produced in you by the now-working and influencing
Spirit.&nbsp; Creatures of the present, there is a present
salvation for you; and that does not mean merely that you have
for yourselves to seek and lay hold of a ready salvation, but
that a merciful and grace-giving <span class="smcap">God</span>,
a loving Saviour, an indwelling Spirit, are present with you, and
personally operating upon you for your salvation.</p>
<p>Dear brethren, try to understand and feel this.&nbsp; Do not
suppose that <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> gifts are in
any way separated from the Giver by time or by distance.&nbsp;
Once for all, He resolved to give, but severally as each needs
and rightly seeks, He gives; and when He gives, it is not by
messengers, through long mediums, <i>but out of His own
hand</i>.&nbsp; The bread which we break and the cup which we
bless, <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>are the communion of the Body and Blood of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; The bread is not the Body, nor
the wine the Blood, nor is the reception of them the way of
applying to us any stored up blessings; but when we keep the
ordinance which <span class="smcap">Christ</span> has appointed,
then He fulfils His promise of blessing us, and, with the sign,
Himself the reality enters into our souls.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">There present in the
heart,<br />
Not in the hands, th&rsquo; eternal Priest<br />
Will His true self impart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so of all other ordinances.&nbsp; They are nothing, and
give nothing of themselves.&nbsp; Their whole value&mdash;but
what an unspeakable value it is&mdash;consists in their being
appointed ways of bringing us into direct communication with a
present <span class="smcap">God</span>, our Father, our Saviour,
our Sanctifier!</p>
<p>But there is another view to take of present
salvation&mdash;namely, that from its very nature, it cannot be
received at any one time in perfection, in such a state as to
need no care to preserve it, no sustentation and renewal, no
constant direction and blessing from the Author, and Regulator,
and Finisher of it.&nbsp; It is spiritual life.&nbsp; Who does
not know to what hazards life may be exposed, and how, from its
very nature, it requires to be fed with proper food, and kept in
health, and exercised, <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>and developed?&nbsp; It is a
spiritual sap.&nbsp; And what a mockery of life and support to
the branch, would be one single, separated, unrenewed imparting
from the vine, of the sap, which indeed ceases to be sap when the
flow from the trunk is interrupted!&nbsp; The work of salvation
is <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> work, begun by Him,
continued by Him, and to be completed by Him&mdash;therefore, it
must have His continued personal superintendence.&nbsp; He must
work in us to will and to do of His good pleasure.</p>
<p>Thus is salvation <i>present</i> as distinguished from the
<i>past</i>.</p>
<p>But in another sense it is now the day of salvation.&nbsp; We
have not to expect it as a thing wholly future, we must not delay
to close with it as though there were a better time and way of
doing that to be afforded hereafter.&nbsp; Salvation is present
in its rewards and effects.</p>
<p>This, again, is a truth we need to be impressed with.&nbsp; We
are wont to look too much to the future, to <i>hope</i> to be
with <span class="smcap">God</span> hereafter, to <i>long</i> for
salvation, to sigh for the season of sanctification.&nbsp; By and
by we shall be comforted.&nbsp; By and by we shall be
strengthened.&nbsp; By and by we shall be holy and happy!&nbsp;
Thus it is that we only expect salvation, that we persuade
ourselves that <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>we are not to receive anything here by way of real
spiritual joy and blessing, and that we are not required to reach
any high degree of spiritual excellence here!&nbsp; But,
brethren, how unreasonable is this persuasion.&nbsp; To believe
that <span class="smcap">God</span> is present with us and
operating upon us, and pouring out His benefits upon us all our
lives, and yet that we are none the better, that we do not derive
any blessedness from Him: or, again, to believe that <span
class="smcap">God</span> has given us spiritual life, that He
imparts to us, and constantly superintends, the grace which
justifies and sanctifies; and yet that we can, or at least need
make no use of this grace, not grow in it, not become purer, and
holier, that it is ineffectual, that we may consent to its being
ineffectual till life is over&mdash;O is not such a persuasion
unreasonable, are we not ashamed of it?&nbsp; Imagine a mother
not feeding or taking care of her infant, and yet counting on its
thriving! or, fondly and diligently tending, taking care of her
infant, and continuing to do so year after year, yet perfectly
satisfied though it gained no strength, did not grow, nor walk,
nor speak, nor show the slightest sign of getting out of
babyhood!&nbsp; Imagine, I say, satisfaction with such a state,
and hope all the while, yea, conviction, that presently, when the
usual number of years were <a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>over the child would somehow be a
man!&nbsp; Or, imagine the husbandman expecting a harvest without
sowing, or ploughing; or planting his field diligently, and
rejoicing in refreshing rains, and ripening suns, yet not
disappointed if the ear did not ripen, or even if the blade did
not spring up; not concerned about it, not expecting it, sure of
harvest at the usual time, even if that usual time should be next
week, and there were yet no sign of a crop!&nbsp; Imagine this!
you say.&nbsp; Such imagination is idle; it is a mockery of
common sense to suppose such a thing possible.&nbsp; Well, then,
my brethren, what is to be said of the spiritual nurses of the
new life of <span class="smcap">God</span> in the soul, of the
spiritual husbandman of the seed of grace in the heart, who do
nothing towards, or who expect nothing of present
salvation?&nbsp; Brethren, <span class="GutSmall">NOW</span> is
the day of salvation, the day in which salvation is offered, in
which it is actually conferred, in which it should be working and
growing, yea, and bestowing its joy and peace.&nbsp; If in aught
of this it fails, be sure there is some fault in
yourselves&mdash;it is not that grace is of itself unreal, or
unproductive, but that you receive it in vain, that you do not
sufficiently heed and reverence it, that you do not sufficiently
guard it, and sustain and refresh it, that you do not
sufficiently use it.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>There
ought to be in every baptized Christian, a gradual, steady, and
even perceptible Christian progress.&nbsp; Our salvation ought to
be ever nearer and nearer than when we believed, not only in the
expectation of our complete adoption and removal to glory, but in
our fitness for glory, and desire and hope of it.&nbsp; If we
have the same evil tendencies, are as easily overcome by the same
temptations, have the same dislike or imperfect taste for
spiritual occupations, the same poor appreciation of religious
privileges and hopes as we had a year, a month, a week ago, then
assuredly our salvation stagnates, we are not using what <span
class="smcap">God</span> has given us, we are not yielding to, we
are resisting His living influence!&nbsp; Grace, my brethren, is
an useless gift, if it is to effect nothing: a time of probation
is an idle space, if there is no trial.&nbsp; Faith is little
entitled to be called &ldquo;the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen,&rdquo; if it produces no
spiritual conviction: and as for hope&mdash;what kind of anchor
is it to the soul, if it is ever shifting, if it grasps
nothing?</p>
<p>If any man is in <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, he is a
new creature, that is, he is becoming a new creature, with new
life, and powers, and energies, and tastes, and aims, and
hopes.&nbsp; He will grow in grace if he <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>has rightly
received it, and in the knowledge and love of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; He will manifestly (at least
to himself manifestly) be putting off the old man with his
affections and lusts, and putting on the new man, which after
<span class="smcap">God</span> is created in righteousness and
true holiness.&nbsp; He will endure trials more and more
patiently, as seeing more clearly Him who is invisible.&nbsp; He
will resist temptations more easily, and do good more
consistently and gladly, and be more pained and more penitent
after every sin.&nbsp; He will have a growing love of searching
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> word, and speaking to Him
in prayer and praise, and receiving Him in Holy Communion.&nbsp;
He will gradually be raised above the world, and will soar higher
in imagination and affection and hope towards heaven.&nbsp; Each
day will have witnessed some advance&mdash;or some more than
recovery if there has been a relapse.&nbsp; And when the night
cometh, the end of the day of attaining salvation, he will want
but little to complete his resemblance to <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, his pattern, and to perfect his
salvation.</p>
<p>If, then, brethren, you would obtain an answer to the
momentous question, Whether you shall be saved, whether there is
a good hope that you are in the way of salvation, I would bid you
not so much look back to your Baptism and Confirmation, <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>and count
the number of your attendances on Holy Communion, of the sermons
you have heard, the prayers and praises you have
offered&mdash;though these are all great things&mdash;but rather,
I would say, ascertain whether you have present salvation, for
the future depends on the present; and to ascertain this, examine
well whether you are putting off the old man and putting on the
new, as I have just described.&nbsp; As another test&mdash;and a
very great help in godliness, to which there is no equal in
feelings and exercises&mdash;inquire into your hope of future
salvation (by which I do not mean only your expectation, but also
your eager desire), and into your joy for present salvation.</p>
<p>If religion is a reality, it is a great reality.&nbsp; Its
immediate blessings are so precious, and its prospects so
transcendently glorious, that the man who is not filled with joy
and desire on their account, has no part or lot in them, or is
strangely culpably ignorant of his privileges and his
hopes.&nbsp; No wonder that he easily yields to sin, that he
finds spiritual employments wearisome, that he makes no progress
in salvation.&nbsp; If <span class="smcap">God</span> touches him
and he feels not, if heaven has come down to him and he knows it
not, if glory is revealed to him, and he does not burn for it, if
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> has put him in the ark and he
is not comforted by the <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>immediate deliverance and counting
on the perfect salvation&mdash;then, surely, he has received the
grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> to little sanctifying,
and so to little saving purpose!</p>
<p>O let him beseech <span class="smcap">God</span> earnestly and
perseveringly to give him spiritual sight and feeling, to fill
him with joy and peace in believing, to make him rejoice, not
only for what he has, but for what he expects of salvation;
working, like St. Paul, in view of the crown laid up, confident
that, whether absent or present, he is accepted by <span
class="smcap">God</span>, knowing that to depart is to be with
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>.</p>
<p>But, lastly, let him guard and pray against mistaking
<i>present</i> for perfect salvation, the road and discipline and
growth for heaven, for heaven itself.&nbsp; The possession which
he has, precious as it is, is not a perfect one; and, moreover,
he may lose it.&nbsp; Remember Paul&rsquo;s care, lest he should
be a castaway, his caution to take heed lest we fall, his fearful
sayings about forfeited grace.&nbsp; O brethren, seek as the best
immediate blessing and the best stimulus to godliness, an
assurance of hope in perfect salvation.&nbsp; But be sure that it
is founded upon the reception and right use and evident growth of
grace, upon present salvation; and, withal, be not high-minded,
but fear.&nbsp; You know your own frailties, the influences of
the <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>world, the subtlety and tremendous power of
Satan&rsquo;s temptations.&nbsp; Any of these is sufficient to
make you wander out of the right way, or stand still, or turn
back, or to cause you to faint in your spiritual course, and even
to threaten the destruction of your spiritual life.&nbsp; You are
sure of <span class="smcap">God</span>, of His favour, of His
upholding, of His preserving you unto the day of perfect
redemption; but you are not sure of your observance of the
conditions on which only you may count on Him.&nbsp; And if you
disregard these conditions, then are you plainly taught, by
precept and example, that a neglected <span
class="smcap">God</span> will not abide with you, and a resisted
Spirit will not strive with you, and that grace received in vain
will be taken away.&nbsp; Remember this, let it keep you from
presumption, make you watchful against temptation, always clothed
in the armour of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and wielding the
sword of the Spirit, and abounding in the work of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>; praying, too, always, that the present
may be an earnest of the future, that the Spirit will sustain,
and sanctify, and perfect you, and that <span
class="smcap">God</span>, Who has begun a good work in you, will
perform it until the day of <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>.</p>

name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>many of
these in every crowd.)&nbsp; Then there were the scribes and
lawyers, always talking about, listening to, or disputing
religious truths&mdash;never coming, or caring to come, to the
knowledge and practice of the truth.&nbsp; Then there were the
seekers after loaves and fishes, who hoped to get something by
coming.&nbsp; Then there were the entrappers and enemies of our
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, seeking for witness against Him,
hoping to see some work done, to hear some word said which might
form the ground of accusation against Him.&nbsp; And, lastly,
there were some&mdash;a few only&mdash;whom faith impelled to
seek from Him the healing of their diseases, the relief of their
burthens; and whom love drew after Him, to see Him, to serve Him,
to dwell upon the gracious words that proceeded out of His
mouth.&nbsp; Of the last class was a woman who had been afflicted
with a grievous malady for twelve years, who had tried all
earthly means of relief, and had grown worse under them, who was
despised and shut out from the company of mankind by reason of
her visitation, who had become destitute in seeking cure.&nbsp;
All things were against her.&nbsp; Her misfortunes were what many
would describe as more than could be borne.&nbsp; Her case was
hopeless.&nbsp; Nothing seemed left to her but to succumb to
helpless misery, and wait in groans <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>and tears for death&mdash;when, lo!
a sudden gleam of brightest hope burst upon her, there was a
Physician Who could cure all diseases, and His remedy was to be
had without price!&nbsp; It does not appear whether the fame of
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> had reached her in some remote
place, whence she had dragged her poor afflicted body, sighing
and groaning, wandering many days, searching in many places; or
whether, being &ldquo;accidentally,&rdquo; as men say, near where
the crowd passed, she had now heard, for the first time, of the
new Prophet; and, gathering from the passers-by that He was going
to restore a dying damsel, concluded that the possessor of such
power, so graciously exercised, could and would heal her
too.&nbsp; Be that as it may, she had full faith in His ability:
&ldquo;If I may but touch his clothes I shall be
whole.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, having such faith, she resolved to act
upon it, making her way through the crowd, and doing that,
through which her faith suggested the power would be
transmitted.&nbsp; How she came to propose to herself, or who
proposed to her, such a course, how much of ignorance and
superstition there was in it, is beside our present
consideration.&nbsp; Her faith, her perseverance, her humility,
are rather the things to be noted.&nbsp; Her faith, which was so
strongly convinced of the existence in <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and the <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>certainty of being able to obtain
from Him the grace of healing.&nbsp; Her perseverance, poor,
feeble, tottering woman! which was not overawed by the greatness
of the crowd, and did not give up when she was dragged hither and
thither, hard pressed here, shut out there&mdash;perhaps even
thrown down and trampled on more than once.&nbsp; Her humility,
which&mdash;eager as she was for cure, bent, too, as she was upon
having it&mdash;made her fear the eyes of the crowd, though she
cared nothing for their thrusts and hard usage, which dared not
face her Healer; which caused her to shrink back from the first
touch, and seek to hide herself, and steal away with the
blessing.</p>
<p>Pausing here for a moment, brethren, to consider that this
woman, in her malady, is a type of all who are affected with the
disease of sin; that in the fruitless issue of her recourse to
earthly physicians, she allegorises the vanity, the mockery, of
all human expedients to restore or ameliorate moral distempers;
showing that such &ldquo;remedies&rdquo; do but cause to suffer
more, and make worse&mdash;pausing, I say, to consider this, and
to reflect that herein we have a representation of ourselves as
sinners, of our helplessness but for <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, of our greater suffering and sure
deterioration, through our very efforts to become better without
<a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span><span
class="smcap">Christ</span>; reflecting on this, realising it,
and feeling it, are we able to go on and see in her discovering
of the right Healer, in her efforts to be healed by Him, in her
faith, and perseverance, and humility, what we have discovered,
what we believe, and what we do, and what we feel?&nbsp; O what a
pitiable sufferer is that, who hears with indifference or with
lukewarm inactive belief, that there is a Physician that can make
well; who knows that He is ready, that restoration is to be had,
and yet does not seek it; who even pleads infirmity as a reason
for not striving to be cured; who is deterred by the sight of a
crowd that must be got through; who is discouraged by the first
obstacle, and gets up and goes back after the first fall!&nbsp;
And how blinded are the senses, and how dead the feelings of the
sinner, who does not feel the degradation of his state, but makes
open display of himself before the crowd, and with a bold front
and unshrinking touch, comes to the All-pure and All-holy to be
healed!&nbsp; Learn, fellow sinners, from this poor woman, what
your sin is, how defiling, how miserable, how sure to grow worse
under human treatment.&nbsp; Learn, too, by Whom alone it can be
healed, and with what efforts, and what feelings, you must seek
the healing.&nbsp; For, consider how the All-seeing eye and the
All <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>sympathising heart beheld and loved that woman, for her
deeds and feelings.&nbsp; <i>Before</i> she touched Him, the
virtue, the power of healing, was made ready to flow; and, as
soon as she had touched, she was called forth, and commended, and
owned, and further blessed: &ldquo;Daughter, thy faith hath made
thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Partly, no doubt, for the sake of others, this manifestation
and speech were made.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
generally hid His wondrous works from the gaze of the masses, and
forbade that they should even hear of them by the hearing of the
ear: just as He concealed the meaning of His speech by veiling it
in parables, hard to be understood, that mere curiosity might not
be indulged, that faith might have some privilege over want of
faith, that needless provocation of His enemies might be avoided,
and witness against Him withheld, that those who He knew would
see and hear in vain, might be spared the greater condemnation of
beholding and despising.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, an exception
was made, and <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> spoke and acted
openly; that those present might see, and those absent might hear
of Him, and so come unto Him and be saved.&nbsp; This may have
been the case here.&nbsp; Or, more probably, the manifestation
was not so <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>much for the multitude, it was for the inner circle;
for Jairus, whose faith needed to be prepared, for the shock of
the coming announcement&mdash;&ldquo;Thy daughter is dead, why
troublest thou the Master any more?&rdquo; or for better heeding
of the injunction, &ldquo;Be not afraid, only believe;&rdquo; for
the disciples, too, whom He would thus confirm in the faith, and
prepare for their mission and sufferings, whom He would thus
enable to record for our instruction and comfort, the things
which <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> has done, which He is ever
ready to do again.&nbsp; But, specially, it was for the woman
herself; that she might not suppose that she had obtained
<i>unknown</i> possession of a blessing, or that it was the mere
touch which cured her, and not the All-knowing Healer, pleased by
her faith and so making effectual an otherwise useless act; that
she might become acquainted with Him, and so learn to love Him,
and gratefully remember Him, and by and by, when she came to know
his will, might delight to do it; that she might have something
more than she sought&mdash;this is ever the rule of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> giving&mdash;the &ldquo;Go in
peace,&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;Be whole of thy
plague;&rdquo; that she might be taught, and we, through her,
that Divine mercy is ever to be acknowledged, and open glory to
be given to <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>The
history is replete with profitable suggestions&mdash;lessons of
faith and practice.&nbsp; Let us select three for present
consideration.</p>
<p>First, let us observe, that we may throng and press <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and yet not touch Him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou seest the multitude thronging Thee, and sayest Thou
who touched me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Even so!&nbsp; The idle, curious,
controversial, captious thronging is nothing accounted of: it is
the touch of eager desire and humble faith which alone is
noticed.&nbsp; At first, brethren, we are tempted to think, that
the most strangely indifferent, the most unblessed of men, are
those who do not join the throng, and press about the <span
class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>.&nbsp; That He is in the
sanctuary, and men do not enter into His presence there; that He
is teaching the way of life, and men will not hear sermons nor
read the Bible; that He may be conversed with, and yet men will
not pray; that He may be touched, and yet sacraments are not
received: this, we think, is as strange as it is sad.&nbsp; And
so, indeed, it is.&nbsp; But it is stranger and sadder, that any
should come into the Sanctuary, and not perceive <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> presence; that they should
hear and read without learning; that they should use words of
prayer and yet not be heard; that they should press and throng
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> in ordinances, and never touch
Him; <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>deriving no benefit from Him, because they seek it not
aright; being beneath His eye, and yet unnoticed; crowding around
Him, and upon Him, and yet unfelt!&nbsp; But assuredly, as of old
it was, so it is now.&nbsp; If mere idleness brings men to the
Sanctuary, mere observance of a decent fashion, if they come only
to hear and see something new, to wile away the time which hangs
wearily upon them, to gain themselves a good name as respectable
and pious, if they are watching to see, what may be criticised,
what may be talked about and condemned, if they are rendering
merely a formal obedience, and offering only an outward
service&mdash;then, I was going to say, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> takes no more notice of them than if
they were not present; but I should rather say, He is wrathful
against them for being present.&nbsp; He blinds their eyes, and
turns away His own.&nbsp; He is dumb to them; they deaf to
Him.&nbsp; He yields nothing to them, though they seem like Moses
to have cleft the rock.&nbsp; He feels them not, though they
squeeze and press!&nbsp; My brethren, it may be that some of you
have long been in the company of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, have missed very few opportunities
of public worship, have become very familiar with the Scriptures,
have often repeated prayers and psalms, have been frequent
communicants, and yet are none the <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>better in feeling and desire, have
experienced no spiritual relief, have no more love or perception
of the truth, than if you had been utter strangers to <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and never been near Him nor heard of
Him.&nbsp; Hence it may be that religion is to you but a name: it
profits you not, it affords you no delight, it exercises no
influence upon you.&nbsp; Would you know why?&nbsp; Because you
have been but thronging and pressing, because you have had no
real sense of your misery, have entertained no real desire to be
relieved and blessed, and so have made no well-directed,
persevering effort to touch <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>!&nbsp; You are, as you feel, no
better, no wiser, than if there were no <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, or you had never been near
Him!&nbsp; And you will never be wiser and better, however much
you press and throng, till you realise your want, and are
convinced that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> alone can
relieve it, and come to Him faithfully, resolutely, humbly, to
touch the hem of His garment, and be healed of your plague.&nbsp;
First, then, strive to know what you want, and to be convinced
that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> can and will grant it;
and, then, feeling the desire of it, being sure from Whom alone
it can be had, and how it must be sought, draw near&mdash;with
the feeling of necessity, with the perseverance of desire, with
the consciousness of unworthiness&mdash;and effect the <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>touch of
faith.&nbsp; You shall not, in that case, remain unblessed; your
plague shall be stayed, your faith shall be commended, your
effort crowned, your humility exalted; you shall have more than
you sought; enlarge your desire as you will, it shall be more
than satisfied: and He whom you would but touch, and then shrink
away, shall call you forth, and own, and bless you, and give you
everlasting peace and perfect salvation.</p>
<p>Next, let us observe, that nothing can keep back and nothing
hide from <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; We are
sometimes tempted, in the deep sense of our unworthiness, in
review of the distance between us and the Healer, of the many
obstacles which intervene, to give up in despair, and say to
ourselves, &ldquo;It is of no use trying, I am not fit for such a
blessing, and if I were, I cannot reach it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now,
consider, who could be more unfit, and who more unable to
approach <span class="smcap">Christ</span> than this poor
woman.&nbsp; There was a positive law which forbade her coming;
her touch was pollution: yet <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
reproached her not with disregarding that law, nor refused her
because of it; and when she touched He did not recoil, but
encouraged her.&nbsp; For <i>us</i> there is no excommunicating
law.&nbsp; From us <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is pledged
not to recoil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come unto me all ye that labour and
are heavy laden,&rdquo; is an <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>invitation, a positive
command.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him that cometh unto Me I will in no wise
cast out,&rdquo; is a most solemn pledge.&nbsp; Why, then, should
we shrink?&nbsp; What shall we fear?&nbsp; And as for
difficulties and hindrances, our own infirmities, the opposition
of the world or the Devil, the sneers of despisers, the distance,
the crowd, the hurrying on, can aught compare with what
threatened this woman, and what she overcame?&nbsp; O are we not
ashamed to forego salvation, to keep away from <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, to desist from determination to
reach Him, by any plea of personal infirmity, or of difficulty in
the way?&nbsp; What in ourselves is worse than the twelve
years&rsquo; growing, enfeebling, overwhelming malady of this
woman?&nbsp; What in aught around us is more impenetrable than
the great crowd? and whenever was <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> as distant from us as He was from
her?&nbsp; And then as to the discouragement which Satan would
suggest to us, that in our age we cannot, like this poor woman,
get anything from <span class="smcap">Christ</span> by stealth;
that the power to heal flows not unconsciously; that He must see,
and approve, and stay for us, and even anticipate us; and that by
reason of our insignificance and the wide extent of His dominion,
it is not reasonable to suppose that we shall be
observed&mdash;brethren, are we not assured, by the <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>fact that
<i>she</i> was discerned, and watched for, and singled out from
the great multitude, that the gaze which is comprehensive enough
to include all is particular enough to distinguish each; that
there is nothing beneath His notice; that He can get through, and
will get through, all that stands between us and Him: that He who
keeps vast globes in their orbits, takes thought even for
sparrows; that He counts the hairs of each individual&rsquo;s
head; that He hears each sigh, and feels each sorrow; that the
roar of the universe is not louder in His ear than the feeblest
cry of distress from the lowest of His creatures?&nbsp; O it is a
blessed assurance, and one for which we should be heartily
thankful, that it was always when there was most to distract,
that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was most closely
attentive; that it was in the most dazzling glare that He saw
most clearly; that it was when He seemed most absorbed in other
aims, that His notice and help were most readily secured; that in
the way to raise the daughter of Jairus, He was so easily stopped
to heal and bless the woman with the issue of blood!&nbsp; No
sight too insignificant to escape His eye; no sound too faint to
reach His ear; no crowd so great as to hide the individual; no
object so engrossing as to exclude from notice, or to hurry on
from concern for the least, the unworthiest of other objects!</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>Lastly, let us observe that power to heal was ready to
flow wherever there was a channel made for it.&nbsp; We are not,
of course, to understand that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
healed unconsciously; that any mere formal touch secured, as it
were, without the violation of His will, the grace which He was
anointed to bestow; but we are to understand, that such is the
law of grace, that where there is a demand there is a supply;
that like as the thirsty sand surely drinks in the rising wave,
like as a sponge absorbs the water into which it is plunged, so
the sensibly void heart, the yearning desire, the faithful
effort, the moral fitness, is sure of what it wants and seeks, if
it is found in the place where what it wants exists.&nbsp; It is
one of the most wonderful, most mysterious, and at the same time
most sure effects of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
incarnation that human nature, needing and desiring, put into
communion with Him, possessing, overflowing, shall have by the
necessary operation of an invariable law, the thing which it
wants, and which He has to bestow.&nbsp; There is no chance, no
mere probability in the case: <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
is the ever-flowing fountain; if you stand beneath, the water
must come over you.&nbsp; He is the root full of sap, if you are
one of the branches joined to Him, the sap shall flow into and
permeate you.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>It is
this which makes ordinances effectual signs of grace; means, not
by which grace may <i>perhaps</i> be bestowed, but by which it is
<i>sure</i> to be bestowed, if they are rightly used.&nbsp; The
woman, whose history we have been considering, might have been
disappointed in her hope: for <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
had not taught her, nor made her any promise, nor prescribed to
her any course; but He has so enlightened <i>us</i> in the
mystery of His Incarnation; He has so pledged to us His grace; He
has so shown us how to obtain it, that we may most confidently
say, &ldquo;If I may but touch, I shall be whole.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Grace, the manifold grace of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> glorified body&mdash;the
source of sanctification and every blessing, is ready to flow,
and will flow as soon as He is touched.&nbsp; Of course, as we
have seen, this touch must be directed by right feeling; but
still, observe, there must be a touch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy faith
hath saved thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not because it kept thee still,
sighing for, talking of, waiting for Me, but because it roused
thee, and made thee encounter so much, and do so much to come and
touch Me.&nbsp; Faith gives quality to the touch, but, after all,
the touch secures the blessing.&nbsp; So it ever is.&nbsp; The
touch necessary, and the touch effectual.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that
believeth <i>and is baptized</i> shall be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Except ye eat the flesh of the <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>Son of man and drink His blood, ye
have no life in you.&rdquo;&nbsp; The water of Baptism is the
laver of regeneration.&nbsp; The bread which we break, and the
cup which we bless, are the Communion of the Body and Blood of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; Using the outward part
rightly, you do certainly receive the inward grace: for as soon
as <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is rightly touched, and
these are appointed ways of touching, immediately&mdash;as it
were, spontaneously&mdash;virtue to heal goes out of Him.</p>
<p>Let it not, however, be supposed, that this view of the way of
healing and sanctifying makes <span class="smcap">Christ</span> a
servant of grace instead of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
of grace; that it directs us to a mere storehouse to help
ourselves, instead of sending us to a living, loving, discerning
Saviour, of Whom we are to crave the help and blessing which are
His to give as He will.&nbsp; No, brethren, it exalts ordinances,
but only because they are <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> ordinances, the clothes in
which He is clad, as He walks among us, the garments through
which power to heal is transmitted from Him to us.&nbsp; The use
of these things without a sense of unworthiness, without humility
and faith, is like the thronging of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> by the crowd, not only unprofitable,
but rude and profane; and this sense of unworthiness, this
humility and faith, together <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>with the power and perseverance to
act upon them, are all the gifts of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, seed sown, increase given by Him
according to His will.&nbsp; Look, then, to the Physician, as
well as to the remedy, to the Giver of grace as well as to the
Channel of grace; and, knowing that without Him you can do
nothing, and except from Him receive nothing, beseech Him to
enable you to seek grace rightly, and then to bestow it freely,
not for any worthiness, for any feeling, for any deed; but simply
because of your necessity, out of His boundless love.</p>
<h2><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>SERMON XVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PREACHING PARABLES.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Ezekiel</span>, <span class="smcap">xx</span>.,
49.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Ah</i> <span class="smcap">Lord
God</span>! <i>they say of me</i>, <i>Doth he not speak
parables</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> had been commissioned with
the utterance of a warning, in figurative but very intelligible
language, that <span class="smcap">God</span> was about to bring
a great calamity upon Jerusalem and all Judah; that young and
old, good and bad, should be affected by it&mdash;&ldquo;I will
kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree and
every dry tree&rdquo;; that the judgment should be irresistible
&ldquo;the flaming flame shall not be quenched,&rdquo; and the
destruction universal; &ldquo;all faces from the south to the
north shall be burned therein.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to some
expositors, as soon as he received this commission, concluding
from his past experience that the Jews would profess not to
understand his message, or would say, that it was an <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>exaggeration, or that it did not apply to them, and so
disregard it, he entreated of <span class="smcap">God</span>, in
the words of the text, that such an excuse might be taken away by
the delivery instead of a plain and unmistakeable warning:
&ldquo;O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, not a parable.&nbsp;
Thy people will not heed parables.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon <span
class="smcap">God</span>, in gracious condescension to His
prophet, in determination to be heard and understood by the
people, substituted for this first message, not indeed wholly
unfigurative language, but a simpler parable, which carried with
it to all its own interpretation.&nbsp; But it is better, I
think, to suppose, that Ezekiel does not here anticipate the
people&rsquo;s perversity, and so persuade <span
class="smcap">God</span> at once to withdraw His words; but that
he narrates and grieves over the actual reception which the
message, faithfully delivered, had encountered.&nbsp; The people
would not hear it.&nbsp; They said it was obscure: a parable, an
enigma, a poetical exaggeration.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> did not speak to them by it; or, if He
did, they could not tell what He said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! <span
class="smcap">Lord God</span>&mdash;alas! it is the old
tale&mdash;I told them Thy words, but they would not hear; they
turned away from me, saying, Surely we cannot understand
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whichever was the case, whether Ezekiel only expected, or
actually experienced this treatment, <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>we are sure that it was not wholly
on account of special obscurities which veiled the matters he had
to declare, nor on account of any special deafness and hardness
of heart which belonged to that people.&nbsp; For every Christian
teacher has had reason to anticipate, has actually endured the
like from Christian congregations.</p>
<p>Often and often in preparing for the pulpit, is the preacher
tempted to set aside some important theme, to withhold some
wonderful truth, to forbear even to suggest some glorious
consolation, because he believes that in uttering it, he will not
have the ears, or, if he has the ears, he will not have the minds
of his hearers; that they will not understand his saying; and so,
of course, will not receive it.&nbsp; Often and often, too, when
having used the full liberty of a Christian prophet and whatever
ability <span class="smcap">God</span> has given him, of
simplifying to the utmost, and recommending with all his energy,
the Gospel message, he is constrained to feel, he is made,
perhaps, by men&rsquo;s open speech to know, that he is regarded
as the setter-forth of unmeaning, extravagant, or inapplicable
words.&nbsp; Of course, this charge is not always
unfounded.&nbsp; We are not inspired: we often speak our own
words; our minds may not have rightly conceived the subject we
would discuss, or we may be wanting <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>in ability to express clearly what
we understand.&nbsp; Under various influences we do, too, at
times speak more or less extravagantly, and our knowledge and
discretion are not so complete, that we invariably select what is
precisely suited to our hearers.&nbsp; In such cases, we ought to
expect, we have no right to complain of, the rejection, the
disregard, or the fruitlessness of our preaching.&nbsp; But,
brethren, when we are sure that the fault lies not in the
preacher, when he has taken pains to enter into and reveal the
mind of the Spirit, to teach what he knows <span
class="smcap">God</span> would have you understand and believe,
to urge what he knows <span class="smcap">God</span> would have
you do, to describe and recommend what he knows <span
class="smcap">God</span> would have you love and seek&mdash;when
he has done this, and you receive not his words, excusing
yourselves by saying that he is obscure, or over-strict, or
fanciful, or enthusiastic, or anything else&mdash;oh! then has he
not a right to complain to <span class="smcap">God</span>? yea;
and is it not his duty to remonstrate with you?&nbsp; Brethren,
we charge not such as you who are here assembled with the
wilfulness of Ezekiel&rsquo;s hearers.&nbsp; In you we do not
suppose there is any actual unbelief, or deliberate dislike of
the truth.&nbsp; It is not forced in your case upon unwilling
ears: for you come to hear it.&nbsp; It is not rejected because
<a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>you hate
it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we have somewhat against many of you of
Ezekiel&rsquo;s complaint, respecting your treatment of the read
or preached Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>We have to complain, brethren, that many of you are under the
mistaken notion that you have almost a right to select the
preacher&rsquo;s theme, at least to dictate its mode of
treatment; and that if your right is disregarded, then you are
justified in excusing yourselves for not profiting or
heeding.&nbsp; Bear with me, beloved.&nbsp; Is it not the case,
that you sometimes find fault with the subject of the
sermon?&nbsp; You do not want to hear so much about man&rsquo;s
depravity: you do not like the preacher to make such a point of
observing religious ordinances: what a high standard of morality
he sets up; how strict is the holiness he describes; why will he
discourse of the horrors of hell?&nbsp; So, again, of the manner
of treatment.&nbsp; You do not care for argument; you cannot
enter upon theories; you are weary of quotations of historical
illustrations; the style is too florid, or too bald: it is
poetical; or it is commonplace; or somehow it is not what you
like; and therefore&mdash;I would not say you turn away from it,
but you do not try, as much as you ought, to heed it; and you
excuse yourselves for not improving under it by blaming the
preacher.</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>The
fact is, there is too often a great forgetfulness of the fact,
that when the preacher speaks to you it is your part to be as
listeners and learners of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp;
It is not for you to choose the subjects, nor to dictate the
method of teaching.&nbsp; It is true, perhaps, that your taste
and aptitude are greater for some subjects than others: it is
true that you are more easily enlightened, and impressed, and
influenced in some ways than in others.&nbsp; It is natural, and
I would not say it is wrong, for you to prefer those subjects and
ways; but be sure nevertheless, that it is the very contrary of
wisdom and humility, of reverence for <span
class="smcap">God</span>, of regard for duty and interest, not to
give the most earnest heed to whatever <span
class="smcap">God</span> says to you through His servant, to dare
to treat it lightly, because either of the topic or the way of
handling it.&nbsp; When a message comes to you from <span
class="smcap">God</span>, surely it is no reason for not
receiving it, that you would prefer a message about something
else!&nbsp; And if the diction in which that message is clothed
is hard or distasteful to you, while you may lament it, may ask
for an explanation, may solicit consideration for your taste, or
help in overcoming your distaste, you may not on any account
disregard what has been said.&nbsp; The word gone forth shall not
return.&nbsp; Where the seed has been sown, increase <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>shall be
expected.&nbsp; The day is coming, when all your opportunities
and means of knowing <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> will,
and all your incentives to serve Him, shall be taken account of
by Him Who has afforded them, and then shall the worst preacher,
the most apparently obscure and inapplicable sermon you ever
heard be a witness for or against you, to testify what regard you
had for <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> message, what
humility, what teachableness, what readiness to receive and to do
what was clear, what anxious diligence and pains to understand
what was obscure.</p>
<p>Brethren, you may choose what subjects you will hear discussed
in the secular lecture-hall, and if you do not like the
entertainment you may refuse to be entertained by it, and resolve
to hear no more of it, to dismiss it altogether from your
thoughts.&nbsp; But you do not come to church to be entertained;
you have no option there of selecting or rejecting.&nbsp; It is
your misfortune (though it may be his fault) if the preacher does
not interest you, or the sermon immediately commend itself to
your mind, and to your heart; but, being there, you must hear
whatever is said, and however it is said; and having heard, be
sure you must give account to <span class="smcap">God</span> of
the hearing!&nbsp; Settle this in your minds, impress yourselves
with the solemn <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>authority of the preacher, and with the importance and
responsibility of heeding him, and it will be very seldom that
you will object even in thought, &ldquo;Doth he not speak
parables?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there are particular complaints, about which I would say a
few words specially.</p>
<p>First, there is a complaint against the preaching of
mysterious and profound truths.&nbsp; If the preacher dwells upon
such a subject as the Incarnation of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, the nature of <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> presence with His Church, of
the Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling, or the rationale of the efficacy
of the means of grace; or if he attempts to explain any difficult
text, no matter what pains he may take to simplify the subject,
how he may labour to show its importance and to recommend its
consideration, he is met at once with the objection that he
speaks parables, and so with a tacit refusal to heed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why puzzle one&rsquo;s brains,&rdquo; it is urged,
&ldquo;with such matters, when there are so many simple themes
and easy lessons in the Gospel.&nbsp; I cannot understand such
things.&nbsp; They are too profound.&nbsp; The preaching of them
may be clever, but it is thrown away upon me.&nbsp; I do not want
to work and task my mind, but to warm my feelings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such is the reward the preacher often gets for taking unusual
pains to edify his hearers!&nbsp; Such is the wilful, <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>the
determined ignorance of many of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> people respecting those truths,
the understanding of which most concerns them, and honours
Him.&nbsp; It ought to be sufficient to correct these unwise and
unwilling, to remind them that whatever <span
class="smcap">God</span> has revealed He requires to be accepted,
and that as there can be no acceptance of that which is not
understood, it is a foremost duty of the Christian preacher and
the Christian learner to employ themselves in the solution of
Scripture difficulties, and the comprehension of revealed
mysteries.&nbsp; Such objectors do not intend it, but they
grievously slight <span class="smcap">God</span> when they refuse
to heed so much of His teaching, yea, they even cast a slur upon
His wisdom in striving to teach what, according to them, cannot
be learnt.&nbsp; And are they not unjust to themselves?&nbsp;
Have they really such narrow and shallow understandings, so
impossible to widen and deepen?&nbsp; Would they confess to such
incapacity if they were listening to a scientific lecture? would
they complain if the lecturer introduced them to new facts,
showed them fresh experiments, suggested to them explanatory
theories, sought to make them wiser than they were?&nbsp; Would
they shut their ears at the sound of the first new term: would
they shrink back at the first invitation to tread upon unfamiliar
ground; <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>would they protect themselves against being
enlightened, by claiming to be hopelessly ignorant?&nbsp; Would
they not rather make the most of the opportunity, opening ear and
stretching mind to catch all they could, finding pleasure in
being carried beyond and above themselves, resenting indignantly
a hint that the thing was out of their reach, professing,
somewhat ostentatiously pretending a greater delight and fuller
understanding than they really had?&nbsp; O why is it the fashion
to claim to be so wise in secular matters, to boast of ignorance
in religion?&nbsp; It is well, indeed, that men should not sham
to be wise in <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> presence,
but it is ill, very ill, that they sham to be ignorant, or that
they should be content to be ignorant when they might be wise,
ignoring and disowning the powers which <span
class="smcap">God</span> has given them!</p>
<p>Take these remarks, dear brethren, into your serious
consideration.&nbsp; Remember that <span class="smcap">God</span>
has given you intelligent minds, in order that you might think of
and serve Him with understanding.&nbsp; Much, indeed, about Him
is absolutely incomprehensible; much has He designedly withheld;
before many mysteries, has He put up the warning, &ldquo;Draw not
nigh hither;&rdquo; but much has He told you plainly, and much
has He propounded in sufficiently obscure or difficult terms, to
task <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>and
exercise your minds in their necessary unravelling.&nbsp; With
respect to these things, as it is only by much resistance that
you can withstand the temptations to which you are exposed; as it
is only by great efforts that you can acquire the holiness
without which no man shall see the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, so is it, only by real and often hard
study, that you can attain unto the knowledge of which <span
class="smcap">God</span> has made you capable, and in which He
bids you grow.&nbsp; The elementary, the vitally necessary truths
of the Gospel are, it may be, within the immediate comprehension
of the simplest and most uncultivated understanding; but shall
it, therefore, be said to you, shall you be allowed to say of
yourselves, that you need not be concerned about anything
beyond?&nbsp; Would you be satisfied if you had only so much
secular education as would enable you to spell out sign-post
directions?&nbsp; Would it be no reproach to you, having so many
faculties and opportunities, only to be able to read and
count?&nbsp; Would you miss nothing of duty, of interest, of
pleasure, if your intellect were uncultivated, if you were wholly
unacquainted and totally unable to appreciate arts and sciences,
poetry, music, literature, or any facts or theories not connected
with your worldly calling, not necessary to procure your daily
bread?&nbsp; Would <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>not life be irksome and intolerable, if held only on
such terms?&nbsp; Would you not be ashamed of attempting to hold
it on these terms?&nbsp; Would you not consider that you were
robbing yourselves of all that was worth having?&nbsp; Would you
not admit that you had missed and ignored your high calling, your
power to be enlightened and wise beings, and had sunk shamelessly
and guiltily to the level, below the level&mdash;for he answers
the end of his creation&mdash;of the irrational brute?&nbsp; And
shall you who feel such shame for worldly ignorance, shall you
who make such efforts to gain secular knowledge, who are ever
widening your minds, and storing up in them as much as they will
hold, who delight in growing wiser and more learned, who will
study unwearily, and exercise all your intellect, and consume I
know not what time, in unravelling the worthless mystery of some
enigmatical line in a poem of fiction&mdash;shall you contentedly
pass over the difficulties, and remain ignorant of the mysteries
which meet you in nearly every verse of the Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Shall you be otherwise than glad
and attentive when the preacher draws your attention to
them?&nbsp; Shall you even unfairly and ungratefully charge him
with <i>speaking</i> parables, when he is really
<i>explaining</i> parables?</p>
<p><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Dear
brethren, it is rarely that the public preacher, who has to take
thought for the simpler ones of the flock, can enlarge upon
profound truths.&nbsp; When he does, take care that you make the
most of the rare occurrence, and compensate for the forbidden
frequency, by diligent private study, by ready use of that
individual aid which the clergyman is as rejoiced, as he is
bound, to afford you.&nbsp; Acquaint yourselves now, as far as
may be, with <span class="smcap">God</span>, and the things of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Furnish yourselves with the
answer, the want of which was such a reproach to Nicodemus, to
the question&mdash;&ldquo;How can these things be?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Show, at least, as much interest in salvation, in sanctification,
in heaven, in eternal bliss, as will lead you to inquire what
they are, and require, and promise.&nbsp; Get now the germ of
that knowledge, which is to expand hereafter albut to an infinite
grasp, and is to revel in spiritual science.&nbsp; Cast away the
reproach of knowing not; provide against the doom which awaits
him that improves not the talents entrusted him: &ldquo;From him
that hath not, shall be taken away even that he seemeth to
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is another class of objectors&mdash;to another kind of
preaching.&nbsp; Those, namely, who resist the force of plain
exhortations to repentance, self-denial, <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>submission,
obedience, holiness, and the like; by persuading themselves that
the preacher urges these severely and unduly.&nbsp; Doth he not
speak parables, they say, exaggerating&mdash;describing ideal
duties?&nbsp; Surely, what he urges is not the thing really
required of us; surely, if we escape not with impunity, yet some
allowance will be made for our want of it.&nbsp; Would he bring
in all guilty?&nbsp; Would he cross every delight and desire of
our life?&nbsp; Would he expect us so to subdue the spirit, so to
overcome natural impatience, as never to resent, to shrink, to
murmur?&nbsp; Must obedience be so uncompromising, so constant,
so perfect, to be obedience at all?&nbsp; Is holiness so
imperatively necessary?&nbsp; Surely the preacher is
unreasonable, he is extravagant, he speaks parables.&nbsp; These
objectors are easily answered.&nbsp; In this matter no teaching
of our own can be more explicit, more exacting, more positive,
and more unsparing, than that of the New Testament.&nbsp; When we
enforce these things, we are backed by an authority which cannot
be questioned; and are able to prove that our words are those of
soberness and truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except ye repent, ye shall all
likewise perish.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever doth <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>not this,
cannot be my disciple.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever loveth me,
keepeth my commandments.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If any man love not
the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>, let him be anathema
maranatha.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Without holiness no man shall see
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Are these words
parables, are they untrue, figurative, extravagant?&nbsp; And if
not, what that we say, or can say, on this head, may be resisted
or slighted, under the plea, that is a parable?</p>
<p>Once more.&nbsp; When we discourse from the pulpit, on a
living and near Saviour, an indwelling Sanctifier, a surrounding
spiritual tempter, on heaven or hell, on enduring as seeing Him
who is invisible, on having our conversation in heaven, on the
evidence of things unseen, on the feeling and grasping, so to
speak, as though they were substantial and at hand, of things
hoped for&mdash;oh! then, how many there are who hear us as
though we were dreamers or narrators of fables, speakers who
should be allowed some poetic license; who, to make their speech
attractive, or perhaps from the spontaneous dictation of their
enthusiasm, use figures of rhetoric and speak parables!&nbsp; I
do not mean that these persons wilfully take up this position,
that they are intentionally, or in desire, gainsayers of the
truth, but merely that they do <a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>not enter into its conception, and
cannot rise to its height.&nbsp; They lag behind, they are
earthy, they see only the visible, feel only the tangible to
bodily senses.&nbsp; The temporal to them is real; the spiritual,
not through unbelief, nor obstinacy, nor moral blindness, but
from infirmity, and earthly-mindedness, and unspirituality, is
regarded too nearly as unreal; and, therefore, when it is
discoursed upon, they seem to be listening to empty dreams, and
the preacher to be displaying flights of fancy.</p>
<p>Dear brethren&mdash;I speak to such&mdash;I know that many of
you wish it were otherwise; you would that your mind could
conceive, and that your heart could feel, these truths.&nbsp; In
your best moments, you more than suspect that the preacher is
right after all, and you are wrong; that <i>you</i> are dreaming,
and not he; that his words are a parable only to those who will
not see and hear.&nbsp; It is not in man to afford you much help,
in coming to a right state.&nbsp; If I refer you to the Bible,
which we do but echo from the pulpit, you will still say, Ah! but
does not this, too, speak parables?&nbsp; If I bid you go and
exercise your reason, or consult others who have done so, it is
more than possible that you will come away from the
consultation&mdash;alas! many do&mdash;more convinced <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>than before
that we <i>do</i> speak parables, that each one is a <span
class="smcap">God</span> to himself, that there is no other devil
than a man&rsquo;s own evil passions, that there is no hell but
in a remorseful conscience, that eternity does not mean
&ldquo;for ever!&rdquo;&nbsp; No; there is no help for you in
man, in yourselves, or in others.&nbsp; You must, indeed, purify
and elevate your affections, so that they may wish for better
things; you must bring down your reason from the high seat where
it sits, and speculates, and dictates; you must try to accept the
truth that the natural man cannot receive nor judge of spiritual
things; but, then, you must go to <span class="smcap">God</span>
Himself, and humbly, teachably, earnestly ask for that spiritual
discernment which alone can see, and feel, and love the things of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Do this, not once, but
often; not negligently or hastily, but earnestly and
perseveringly; and presently, if not all at once, yet gradually,
most surely, your spiritual eyes shall be opened, you shall see
<span class="smcap">God</span>, you shall love <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, you shall perceive the motions of
the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; The invisible world shall be unveiled, and
shall be found to contain all the beauties, all the horrors, and
to hold out all the hopes and fears, to be as real, as near, as
sure to be ours, for weal or woe, according as we are, or are
not, Christians, as the preacher or the <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>Bible, of
which he is the expounder, asserts.&nbsp; Thenceforth you will
not complain of spiritual teaching that it is parabolic, of
strong assertions of the obligation of Christian graces, that
they are immoderate, too exacting, too severe.&nbsp; No! heart
and mind will testify, and life will approve, &ldquo;Lo, now
speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes;
and knowing somewhat of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and your
relation to Him, and desiring to know more, whenever in your
private reading of the Bible a difficulty meets you, or whenever
the preacher discourses, as it seems, in parables, you will give
the most earnest and interested heed, to see if you cannot divine
the mystery; and failing that, instead of remaining in willing
ignorance, you will use all the means placed within your reach,
the comparing of parallel places, your commentaries, and the
private instructions of your clergyman, pleading all the while
with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and urgently beseeching
of Him, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, thou knowest all
things, declare unto me this parable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus doing, you will soon find that to you it is given to know
the mysteries of religion; and the knowledge, sanctified by the
Spirit, will assuredly work in you a greater love of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, a more consistent and more successful
pursuit of holiness, a <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>growing taste and eagerness for that
better state, whence ignorance, in all its degrees, shall be
banished for ever, and where we shall know even as now we are
known.</p>
<h2><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>SERMON XVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LIVING AND DYING UNTO GOD.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">II. <span
class="smcap">Corinthians</span>, <span class="smcap">v</span>.,
8, 9.</p>
<p><i>We are confident and willing rather to be absent from the
body</i>, <i>and to be present with the</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; <i>Wherefore we labour</i>,
<i>that</i>, <i>whether present or absent</i>, <i>we may be
accepted of Him</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> apostle had been speaking, in
the preceding chapter, of the troubles and persecutions which he
daily endured, and of the hopes and consolations&mdash;the life
by faith rather than by right&mdash;which made their endurance
easy.&nbsp; Having touched upon the theme, he could not but
enlarge upon it; and doing so, his ardent expectations carried
him out of the present, and made him covet and attempt to grasp
the future.&nbsp; Before his enlightened eye and spiritualised
heart, his affliction was light and its continuance brief; the
present state was but as a tent, quickly to be <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>taken down,
and then in its place should be digged the deep foundation and
reared the abiding edifice of a building of <span
class="smcap">God</span> eternal in the heavens.&nbsp;
Outstretched, then, were his thoughts, and desires, and earnest
were his prayers, not so much to get rid of what he had, as to
attain what he hoped for and was promised.&nbsp; He knew indeed
that the tabernacle must be removed; that his present state must
cease&mdash;either by actual death or by a change, which the
quick at <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> coming must
undergo, much the same as death; he felt the burthen which was
upon him; he yearned and groaned to be rid of it; but looking to
the end he disregarded the way; dwelling, not upon the change but
what was to come after it, he sought not death, but life.&nbsp;
He longed, not to be unclothed, but clothed upon.&nbsp; Nay,
recognising the good, and so the desirableness of this life,
shrinking too naturally from the thought of dissolution, he would
keep the present till he had the future, he would have what he
wanted <i>added</i> to what he possessed, rather than
<i>substituted</i> for it.&nbsp; Present life was in many
respects dear to him; he would that the evil were purged away
from it, and the good left; and then that the good were
augmented, enfolded, absorbed by the transcendent, satisfying
perfect blessedness which <span class="smcap">God</span> had <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>promised,
and for the attaining whereof He had bestowed His effectually
working Spirit.</p>
<p>At this point he seems to have sobered himself, or perhaps
rather to have designedly exhibited the latent soberness and
contentedness which had guided him all along.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
confident,&rdquo; he says, that is, of good cheer, well
comforted, easily bearing what is, patiently waiting for the
future; preferring, indeed (if a preference be allowed), to be
absent from the body and fully present with the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>; but still chiefly animated, not by a
selfish yearning for the quickest attainment of peace and glory,
but by the noble, <span class="smcap">God</span>-adoring
ambition, of being and doing that which is divinely
approved.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore, in view of all that is and
shall be, we make it our chief aim, we devote ourselves, not so
much to reach heaven, to gratify self, as whether on earth or in
heaven, to enjoy the approval and favour of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be silent,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;ye groans for
deliverance; check yourselves, ye eager aspirations for glory;
let principle rule rather than desire, and let the principle be,
whether we live let us live unto the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, whether we die let us die unto the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; Let not dying or living be
the engrossing thought, but that whether we live or die we may be
the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this, as in so many other respects, our bright <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>exemplar,
Paul, shows us both what we may allow and what we should aim
at.</p>
<p>And first he shows us that even the saint&mdash;the approved
of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;may shrink from the
thought of dissolution.&nbsp; &ldquo;We groan, being burthened,
because&rdquo; (this is the right translation) &ldquo;we would
not be unclothed,&rdquo; we would not die.&nbsp; I envy not the
man&mdash;there is something unnatural, yea, and unspiritual,
too, in him&mdash;who does not shrink from the first thought of
death coming to himself or to those whom he loves.&nbsp; For
death, in its best form, is a remembrancer of the wrath of <span
class="smcap">God</span> against the sinner, and it is in a sense
a triumph&mdash;no matter that it is short&mdash;it is a defiling
and withering touch&mdash;no matter that it shall soon be wiped
away, and its blasting undone&mdash;of the foul and fierce enemy
of <span class="smcap">God</span> and holy man.&nbsp; It is that,
too, which cuts asunder the ties which we are allowed and
encouraged to fasten here between ourselves and loved friends and
delightful pursuits and pleasing possessions.&nbsp; It is that,
too, which abruptly closes the period of probation and
preparation for heaven; which stays all cleansing and perfecting,
which says imperatively to us, &ldquo;No more shall you remove,
no more shall you acquire&mdash;as you are shall you face <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;stereotyped are you for
eternity.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is that, too, which enthrals <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>and deadens
the one half of us, though it liberates and quickens the other,
which separates the body from <span class="smcap">God</span>,
while it joins the spirit to Him, which, while it exalts the
latter to Paradise, consigns the former to the grave, to
corruption, to temporary annihilation.&nbsp; Terrible is death to
many, awful to all&mdash;undesirable even to the saint&mdash;and
only tolerable because not so much of the soul&rsquo;s immediate
gain as of the body&rsquo;s future hope.&nbsp; For if it were
proposed to us to choose for eternity between perfect disembodied
bliss, and very imperfect bliss in the body, there is no one, I
conceive, who knows the capabilities of the body, both of
rendering to <span class="smcap">God</span> and receiving of Him,
who would not prefer, and I think rightly, life in the flesh to
life out of it.</p>
<p>The words of St. Paul exhibit in himself, and seem to allow in
others, this shrinking from dissolution, this desire to keep the
body, albeit changed, perfected, caught up into the heavens; to
be spared the pulling down of the earthly tabernacle, even to
make way for the heavenly eternal building.</p>
<p>But St. Paul goes on to show that this desire was secondary to
that of exchanging faith for sight, imperfection for
perfection.&nbsp; He would not on any account remain earthy: he
longed for the <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>fullest and most glorious presence of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and if it needs must be that the
desired change and attainment could only be brought about by
dissolution, oh, then he was ready, he was willing rather to be
absent from the body.&nbsp; He returned from the shrinking; he
rallied from the fear; he was confident, well content, and
desirous to die.</p>
<p>And herein he is the pattern of a true Christian.&nbsp; He is
not so in love with death that he can see nothing in it to shrink
from or fear, nothing to disturb him.&nbsp; He does not so hate
this life as to hurry to be quit of it.&nbsp; With all its
trials, and disappointments, and hindrances, and miseries, there
is much in it which is dear to him, in which he finds delight,
from which he is loth to part.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span>, too, is felt here, and seen by faith,
and bestows appreciable blessings; here <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> work is to be done, here <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> glory to be promoted.&nbsp;
Therefore &ldquo;to live is <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But still there are
greater and better things beyond.&nbsp; There is a place where
trouble never comes, where happiness is perfect, whose company,
and possessions, and pleasures, are such, that nought on earth is
worth having or thinking of in comparison of them.&nbsp; There is
a state in which <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> work may
be done as angels do it, without hindrance <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>from within
or without; in which glory to <span class="smcap">God</span> is
easily, and fully, and delightfully rendered.&nbsp; There is a
presence of <span class="smcap">God</span> which is visible and
palpable, where His voice is clearly heard, where He is beheld
face to face, where the everlasting arms are substantially felt
as they embrace and uphold, where His love is perfectly realised
and enjoyed, and perfectly reciprocated.</p>
<p>What can be valued, or can interest in comparison of all
this?&nbsp; What can content that is short of this?&nbsp; What
can deter from the seeking of this? what valley seem dark and
uninviting at the end of which this glory shines? what way be
dreary and lonely, along which <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> rod and staff are offered as
supporters and comforters?&nbsp; This being the end and the aim,
if to attain it death must be passed through, then welcome
death!&nbsp; We are confident, full of cheer at the prospect,
eager to set out&mdash;&ldquo;To die is gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the best feature of the Christian, as exhibited in St.
Paul, remains for us to gaze on.&nbsp; After all, it is not the
holiest ambition to aspire to heaven; it is not the highest
vocation to enrich and perfect self.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> has made us capable of heavenly
bliss.&nbsp; He offers it to us.&nbsp; He would have us seek it;
He blesses and will reward the <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>seeking.&nbsp; But still He did not
make and redeem us, He does not sanctify us only or chiefly for
this.&nbsp; The Christian&rsquo;s vocation is the service of
<span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; The end of his being is the
glory of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; And so our chief
thoughts, and aspirations, and endeavours, are not to be
deliverance from troubles, perfection in joy, getting out of the
present into the future, exchanging earth for heaven; but, being
and doing what <span class="smcap">God</span> approves, wherever,
in whatever circumstances, <span class="smcap">God</span>
appoints.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore we labour, that whether present
or absent we may be accepted of Him;&rdquo; that whether it
pleases <span class="smcap">God</span> to come to us while we are
in the body, or to call us to Him out of the body, He may find us
prepared for what in either case awaits us; &ldquo;for we must
all appear before the judgment-seat of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, that every one may receive according
to the things done in the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Christian may shrink from the first thought of death, and
wish not to be unclothed.&nbsp; He ought to aspire to heaven, and
that he may reach it, be well content, willing rather, to be
absent from the body.&nbsp; But above all he must labour in
whatever state he is, therein so to be serving <span
class="smcap">God</span>, as to have His present acceptance and
always to be prepared for His coming judgment.</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>We
want to feel this and to act upon it.&nbsp; To put self with even
its most innocent instincts and best interests and noblest
aspirations somewhat aside, that <span class="smcap">God</span>
may be more nearly all in all; to be less filled with groaning
and coveting on our own account and more occupied in serving and
glorifying <span class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; It is well
not to love this world, to have realised its vanity and misery,
to have broken the links that would bind us to it, to refuse to
find our perfect joy in aught that belongs to it.&nbsp; It is
well to yearn for deliverance from all that vexes and hinders and
hurts; to desire ardently&mdash;even to pray earnestly and
continually for&mdash;presence with the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, and all that that presence implies, in
Paradise, in Heaven.&nbsp; But when by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> grace we have come to this
state, we are not perfect, we have not <i>begun</i> to be
perfect.&nbsp; No! we have only qualified ourselves in mind and
heart for the commencement of that which is demanded of us in
life, the single, contented, glad, immediate, and constant
service of <span class="smcap">God</span> in the state and
circumstances in which He has placed us.</p>
<p>Brethren, we are all dwelling in tabernacles, tents that have
no firm foundation; which are to be taken down and soon.&nbsp;
The general judgment may tarry, <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
may not come in His <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>glorious majesty, and meet us while
in the body: but if not then <i>death</i> will surely come, and
out of the body we must go to meet <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&nbsp; How soon shall that be?&nbsp;
How soon shall we meet Him?&nbsp; Do you ever give these things a
serious thought?&nbsp; Do you ever consider that the apparently
capricious last enemy is wont to take the young and strong as
often as the old and feeble, and, <i>as</i> he chooses, sometimes
to sound the warning note from afar off, sometimes to come
silently, suddenly as a thief in the night?&nbsp; Do you
feel&mdash;I single out each man, each woman, each child that
hears me, and in <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> name I
ask that individual&mdash;Do you feel that <i>you</i> may be
Death&rsquo;s next victim, that ere the day is over you may be
gone to your account, or at least the seeds of mortal disease may
be beginning to grow in you?&nbsp; Oh, do not resist this appeal
by persuading yourselves that the thing is improbable.&nbsp; Let
it be enough that you know (and you do know) that it is possible,
and, if possible, that you ought to entertain the
possibility.</p>
<p>Well now, let me farther ask, Are you prepared, are you
preparing to die?&nbsp; Are you going to leave the vast concerns
of an eternal state to the consideration of a moment, a moment
too which may be denied you, if not by the instant <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>cutting of
life&rsquo;s thread, by mortal fears and lingerings, and
recoilings, by the engrossing pains of the body, by the locking
up of the senses in stupor or delirium?&nbsp; Are you putting off
concern; heedless of thought and preparation for meeting <span
class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; Are you calculating upon being
able to think and feel aright when you will, to ask and obtain
pardon for all that is wrong, to be excused for all deficiencies
in a moment, to do the work of life on a sick-bed, to satisfy
<span class="smcap">God</span> with the dregs of the cup of life,
to become a passive recipient of the necessary holiness which
<span class="smcap">God</span> bids all acquire actively?&nbsp;
Do you suppose it will suffice to think of these things when the
doctor tells you you cannot recover; to send for the clergyman to
teach and move you when the faculty of heeding is well nigh gone,
to pray for you, if you are unable to pray for yourself, to sigh
over your body, if, alas! the soul has fled?&nbsp; Or are you now
more or less possessed with religious thought and feeling,
sitting loose to this world, weaning yourselves more and more
from it, nerving yourselves for the last hour, sighing over and
confessing your sins, trusting to <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> mercy, aspiring to heaven,
praying for acceptance?&nbsp; Whether you are indifferent to or
merely postponing concern, for self&rsquo;s best interests, or
whether you are already <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>absorbed by self&rsquo;s best
interests, let me remind you&mdash;without presuming to set any
bounds to <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> mercy, without
disputing that <span class="smcap">God</span> has sometimes
received those who first turned to Him on a death-bed, without
caring to satisfy those who want to know how little religion will
save a man&mdash;let me remind you, I say, and do not be weary of
the repetition, that to be truly acceptable to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, it is not enough that you entertain
some religious thoughts, and go through some religious forms at
the last, or even that you are filled with religious thoughts and
feelings all your life long, you must be serving <span
class="smcap">God</span> now, in the day of your ability, at the
call of every opportunity, in whatever state and circumstances
you are placed, doing it as so much work set you to do and
presently to be scrutinised and accounted for, rendering it as
the faithful, grateful homage of a pardoned and sanctified and
loving sinner.&nbsp; Let this be your rule, a rule to be observed
not only in theory but in practice also; not only in the
rendering of obedience, but in the treating of all that you have,
and the accepting of all that happens to you, as from the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Whether we live, we live
unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, or whether we die, we
die unto the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Come with me</i>, <i>and see my zeal for the</i> <span

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Jehu</span>, the son of Nimshi, one of the
captains of Israel, had been selected and anointed by Divine
command, to supplant King Joram, to smite the whole house of
Ahab, and to avenge the poured-out blood of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> servants, the prophets.&nbsp; It
is easy to account for the choice of such an agent.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span>, we believe, performs no miracle
unnecessarily.&nbsp; When what He wants exists already, He
searches it out and uses it; instead of making a new creation, or
changing and converting what, so to speak, comes first to
hand.&nbsp; At this time He had need, for His purposes respecting
Israel, of a man bold, impetuous, full of vigour, prompt to
undertake, resolute, courageous, uncompromising to perform.&nbsp;
Such an one pre-eminently, <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>was Jehu; and therefore, said the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>, &ldquo;I have anointed thee king
over the people of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, even over
Israel, and thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I
may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets, and the blood
of all the servants of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, at
the hand of Jezebel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We know with what alacrity Jehu assumed his office, and set
about the discharge of its stern and bloody duties; how he drove
furiously to slay Joram, assailing him the while with loud
reproaches for tolerating the wicked doings of Jezebel; how he
caused Ahaziah, king of Judah, to be slain; how he commanded
Jezebel to be thrown from the window, and trod her under foot;
how he effected the wholesale slaughter of seventy persons of
King Ahab&rsquo;s sons, of all his great men, and his kinsfolks,
and his priests, until he left him none remaining; and how, too,
returning from this destruction, he met forty-two of the brethren
of King Ahaziah, and caused them all to be slain at the pit of
the shearing house.&nbsp; The words of the text introduce us to
his last recorded deed of this kind, namely, the destruction by
subtlety of all the followers of Baal, and the suppression of his
worship throughout the land of Israel.</p>
<p>In reading this narrative, the questions naturally <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>arise, How
far were the deeds of Jehu a performance of the Divine
will?&nbsp; Was Jehu in any respect, and if so, in what, a holy
character?&nbsp; Under what influence did he act, and forbear to
act?&nbsp; May we consider these questions rightly, and learn
from them lessons of wisdom by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> grace to be carried out into
holy practice!</p>
<p>There is, then, no doubt, because we may read the command for
it, in plain words, that <span class="smcap">God</span> willed
the destruction of Ahab&rsquo;s whole house and the extermination
of the abominable idolatry of the Zidonians.&nbsp; Jehu seems,
indeed, to have been unnaturally ready for the
executioner&rsquo;s office, to have discharged it savagely, and
to have availed himself of what is never needed or allowed in
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> service, of subtlety,
fraud, lying: but still, making allowance for excesses, arising
from his natural disposition, from his professional familiarity
with deeds of blood, and probably from a proud misconception of
the authority under which he acted, it must be admitted that, in
the main, Jehu so far did the will of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.</p>
<p>Under what influence, prompted by what feelings, he did it, is
a question less easy to answer decidedly.&nbsp; There are
some&mdash;and not a few&mdash;who say that his animus was
altogether bad; that carnage was his delight; and that he
wickedly, <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>and for his own pleasure and private ends, availed
himself of the Divine commission, and served himself under the
pretence of serving <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; That
Jehu was selfish there is great reason to believe, and something
shall be said on that head presently; but that he was a
hypocrite, that his principle, the motive under which he acted,
was wholly bad, is proved not to be the case by the inspired
commendation of him.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> has
made even the wicked for Himself, He uses them to accomplish His
purposes (as He did the Assyrians to punish the Israelites, Satan
to try Job, Judas to betray our <span class="smcap">Lord</span>);
but in such cases as they do of freely devised wickedness, what
He overrules for His own good purposes, He condemns and punishes
them for their offence, though He makes use of it.&nbsp; Now, in
Jehu&rsquo;s case, He praised and rewarded, and so there must
have been something right in him: &ldquo;And the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done
well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done
unto the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart,
thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of
Israel.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the promise was fully realised.</p>
<p>It seems clear, then, that Jehu&rsquo;s deeds not only
accomplished the Divine will, but that they were <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>done with
that design; in obedience and in zeal.&nbsp; They were a
soldier&rsquo;s exact observance of orders, they were the fruits
of a servant&rsquo;s devotion to his master.</p>
<p>We should be able to leave this statement without
qualification were it not for two passages in the chapter of the
text: the one, that in which Jehu makes such boastful mention of
his doings, &ldquo;Come with me, and see my zeal for the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>;&rdquo; the other, that in which the
inspired writer records, &ldquo;Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam
the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from
after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and
that were in Dan.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the first of these we are
compelled to infer that there was an evil leaven pervading his
best obedience; and from the last, that other feelings often
influenced him beside zeal for <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and other lords had dominion over him; so that he wilfully
desisted or was deterred from doing all that was required of
him.&nbsp; Hence it is plain that we must revise our estimate of
his character, to account both for his zeal and want of zeal.</p>
<p>The most satisfactory way of viewing him, to make him at all
consistent, is to suppose that, after all he was not a changed
and converted man, and did not act from spiritual feelings; but
that <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>he
was hitherto employed in pursuits congenial to his natural taste,
and so found his own pleasure in doing the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>.&nbsp; In the destruction of
Ahab&rsquo;s race and the overthrow of Baal, the soldier
exercised the profession which he had chosen and loved.&nbsp; In
daring exploits and deeds of blood, he found a carnal
gratification.&nbsp; Moreover, he was all the while strengthening
and advancing his own cause.&nbsp; His throne was unsafe while
any of Ahab&rsquo;s posterity survived to dispute it with him,
his people&rsquo;s allegiance was not sure while there was any
link with the Zidonians remaining; and the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> displeasure at the idolatry of
Israel, he well knew, would show itself again, as it had done
before, in the withholding of prosperity from them, and allowing
them to be harassed by their enemies.&nbsp; It was, then, a
congenial and politic course which he had hitherto
followed.&nbsp; It may have been done with greater ardour and
satisfaction, because it was the <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> will; Jehu may not at the time
have had any distinct perception of the workings of a lower
motive, but still he would, doubtless, have done all, and done it
as readily and effectually had he owned no allegiance to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, and received no Divine command.&nbsp;
This view of Jehu seems to be corroborated by the fact, that when
the time was <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>come for him to serve <span class="smcap">God</span> in
comparative quietness, he served Him not; and when the
performance of the Divine will in rooting out schism, threatened
to break up the separation of Israel from Judah, by restoring the
worship at Jerusalem, then he not only desisted from the work of
reformation, but gave his countenance to the old error, and
encouraged the people to go after the golden calves, that were in
Bethel and that were in Dan.&nbsp; And so that which he would
have others consider, and which, perhaps, he even believed
himself, was zeal for <span class="smcap">God</span>, was chiefly
the indulgence of his own passions and the service of self; and
it came to pass, that he who had done well, even according to all
that was in <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> heart,
henceforth took no heed to walk in the law of the <span
class="smcap">Lord God</span> of Israel.</p>
<p>Such was Jehu&rsquo;s zeal&mdash;a natural, or mixed, is not
wholly selfish zeal, the zeal of Saul who sought to slay the
Gibeonites, but spared Agag alive; the zeal of the chief priests
and Pharisees who put <span class="smcap">Christ</span> to death,
and demanded Barabbas to be released; not the zeal of Phinehas,
of Josiah, of Him who was always straitened till He did His
Father&rsquo;s will; zeal not so much immoderate or blind, as
blemished and partial; not being always zealously affected in a
good work.</p>
<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>The
review of such a character may be very profitable.&nbsp; How many
of us, my brethren, are very warm, very exact in serving <span
class="smcap">God</span>, in the things to which we are naturally
inclined?&nbsp; How many of us, if we bid not others (as we too
often do), &ldquo;Come with me, and see my zeal for the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>,&rdquo; at least flatter, and puff up
ourselves, in the contemplation of the service which we are
rendering to <span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; How many of us
have only just as much zeal as squares with our own desires or
interests; and in all else, either desist when <span
class="smcap">God</span> urges &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; or persevere
when He cries &ldquo;Forbear!&rdquo;&nbsp; The zealous man has
been advised, by a great moralist, always to suspect that pride,
or interest, or ill temper, is at the bottom of his zeal.&nbsp;
Provided we guard against the grave error, so prevalent in the
last century, of despising and condemning all religious zeal, it
is well to entertain this suspicion&mdash;of ourselves, I
mean&mdash;till we have proved it to be false, or by repentance
and amendment have made it false.&nbsp; For who does not know how
much a proud, carnal, selfish, ill-tempered man or woman may do
in the service of self, which has the appearance of zeal for
<span class="smcap">God</span>?&nbsp; What pious labours men will
undertake, if they happen to be in the path of their natural
inclinations!&nbsp; What warfare they will wage against <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>sins that
they have no mind to!&nbsp; What platform speeches they will
make, what pamphlets or letters publish, against the disciples of
a religious school to which they do not belong!&nbsp; They are
zealously affected; they come out and are separate; they are
enthusiastic, energetic, noisy; they put forth all their own
strength; they invoke the civil power; they would have authority
from the synagogue, if it were to be had, to punish all who do
not conform; they smite with the sharp sword of a bitter
persecuting tongue or pen; they work, they speak, they give, they
fight, they endure&mdash;all, they say, in zeal for the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>; and yet, if you follow them into the
quiet scenes of life, if you come upon them where self has
nothing to gain or enjoy, or where it has anything to lose or
fear losing, to all appearance they take no heed to walk in the
law of the <span class="smcap">Lord God</span>.&nbsp; It is very
likely that they are not communicants; that they are irregular in
their attendance at Church, or greatly wanting in proper
demeanour and devotion when there; that they aid but seldom, and
slenderly, in the spread of religion around them, and the relief
of <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> poor; that they are
rarely seen to open the Bible; not men of prayer; exhibiting
tempers, and following ways which belong not to the holily
zealous; tolerating beneath their own <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>roof, or within the reach of their
influence, something as hateful in the sight of <span
class="smcap">God</span> as the calves that were in Bethel and
that were in Dan.</p>
<p>O how many who are zealous at one time, are without zeal at
another!&nbsp; How many who make a great show of religion, and
talk much about it, and contend in public for it, are utter
strangers to its real influence, are wholly without love for
it!&nbsp; How many, too, who honestly consider themselves zealous
for <span class="smcap">God</span>, are only serving Him in the
bent of their natural inclinations, and taking no heed to Him,
where self must be denied; like men of cold temperament,
despising bodily indulgence, yet making a god of mammon;
prodigals, inveighing against covetousness; destroyers of the
temple of Baal, restorers of the calves of Bethel and Dan; saints
in some things, devils in others!</p>
<p>O ye who boast of zeal, or claim to have it, take care that ye
have it towards <span class="smcap">God</span>, and that ye are
constant in it!&nbsp; Distrust the energy which works only at
times, and in some directions.&nbsp; Suspect the feeling which
excites and fills with ardour to-day, but is listless and dead
to-morrow; which chooses for itself what to do for <span
class="smcap">God</span>, what to think of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, what truth to meditate on chiefly, what
practice alone to follow.&nbsp; Zeal for <span
class="smcap">God</span> is entire, <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>regular, consistent devotion to
Him.&nbsp; It fills the whole man with all spiritual desires and
feelings; it works out in the whole life; albeit, it is generally
calm, and sober, and quiet, not boasting nor thrusting itself
forward, not making much ado.</p>
<p>Do not suppose, brethren, that in speaking thus on the subject
of zeal, I would discourage, in any degree, the entertaining of a
fervent spirit, or would allow, for a moment, that strong feeling
and strong expression of it, and manifested earnest activity,
are, in the slightest degree, incompatible with real
religion.&nbsp; On the contrary, I would maintain that there is
no religion at all in the man or woman who is not&mdash;allowing
for the differences of temperament&mdash;stirred within by it,
and impelled to speak of and act upon it; who is afraid, or
unwilling, or negligent, to show it.&nbsp; Zeal, I maintain, is
good&mdash;nay, is necessary; zeal, which makes one burn with the
glowing thought of immortality, which rouses one to ardent work
and holy contention; which finds, and <i>must have</i>, its vent
in the speech; which shows itself designedly, that it may impress
others, and set forth the glory of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Only, I would have you judge of
that zeal in others, and find it in yourselves; not in what Jehu
did, but in what he omitted, and ought to have done; not in that
which indulges natural <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>desires, but in that which crosses
them; not in that which secures worldly advantages, but in that
which disregards, and even sacrifices them; not in that which
exists, or is quickened only in times and places of excitement,
but which burns brightest and highest, and spreads farthest, in
solitude and silence; not where there is immediate praise, or
glory, or notoriety, in the sight of men, but in that which is
seen alone by <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Seek to be
zealous, rest not till you are zealous, for there is no service
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, no acceptance with Him but
through zeal: but expect to find your zeal, know that there only
<span class="smcap">God</span> will find it, in your deep
conviction of sin, in the fervour of your penitence, in the
uncompromising persecution of your own lusts, in the crossing of
your own will, in the refraining from that you would naturally
choose to do, and the performance of that you shrink from through
worldly motives, in the earnestness of your prayers, in the
frequency of your acts of communion, in the diligence of your
searching of the Scriptures, in the munificence of your private
charities, in the strenuousness of your efforts to do good to
others, in the secret contemplation and desire of heaven, in the
soul&rsquo;s appreciation of your high calling, in faithful love
of <span class="smcap">God</span> in your hearts!&nbsp; Have such
zeal, and manifest and exercise <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>it as often and as consistently as
the Holy Spirit enables you, and then the whole of your life,
within and without, from first to last, shall have the
commendation which Jehu&rsquo;s at the beginning had; and an
infinitely better promise shall be fulfilled to you, Ye shall sit
on the throne of heaven with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
and reign with Him for ever and ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it was the common belief of the
early disciples that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> was to
come in His glorious Majesty, to render unto every man according
to his works, so was it a common desire, a frequent prayer, that
He would come quickly.&nbsp; They were not content with being
merely mindful of the fact that He would come at some time, they
were not merely anxious to be prepared, lest He should come soon;
but they looked for His coming, they hasted towards it, they
loved the thought of His appearing.&nbsp; Some of them, expecting
that they should not taste of death till He had actually appeared
to them in His fullest glory, looked ever with eager eyes for the
opening of the heavens, and the revelation of the Son of <a

others, believing that it was through the gates of death that
they should enter into <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
presence and realise His Second Advent, wished to die, courted
death, yea, hardly resigned themselves to the Divine will, that
they should as yet continue in the flesh.</p>
<p>Perhaps you may think that this was a natural rather than a
spiritual frame of mind.&nbsp; On earth their portion had all
along been one of sorrow and suffering, and evil reproach; and
prophecy bade them look on for aggravations of what they already
endured, and for many additional and greater troubles.&nbsp; What
wonder, then, that they struggled to escape from the present,
that they shrunk from the future, that they prayed that <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> would speedily come to them, or that
He would speedily take them to Himself!&nbsp; What wonder that
St. Paul, for instance, amid his toils, and perils, and
sufferings, and revilings, and failures, and disappointments,
with the prospect of nothing on earth but sorer persecution and
greater trials, should desire to be absent from the body, and to
be present with the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>!&nbsp; What
wonder that St. John, so cruelly entreated by foes, so
disregarded by should-be friends, when in the isle of his
banishment the voice of his <span class="smcap">Lord</span> told
of His speedy coming, should promptly and <a

respond to Him, &ldquo;Even so, come, <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having nothing, and expecting nothing
that flesh could desire; enduring much, anticipating more that
was undesirable, grievous, hateful, what wonder, you would ask,
that they yearned in their hearts to be delivered from such
bondage, and to be transferred to the abode of peace and glory:
that they offered frequently and fervently those Advent prayers,
&ldquo;Thy kingdom come,&rdquo; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus</span> receive my Spirit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Even so, come,
<span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>&rdquo;!&nbsp; Even had they
expected no hereafter, had they supposed that the coming Judge
would annihilate them, or that the grave would bury them in
eternal forgetfulness, it would still have been natural for them
to have courted and prayed for the cessation of toil and the end
of suffering.</p>
<p>So some persons are wont to reason.&nbsp; It is natural, they
say, for those to whom this world is a blank or a sea of
troubles, to set their hopes on another world.&nbsp; It is
natural for those whose life here is all weariness, to be
desirous to give up that life, even though they shall have no
life hereafter.</p>
<p>But is it really natural?&nbsp; Does affliction naturally make
us look heavenwards?&nbsp; Does a troubled life naturally
reconcile us to the thought of <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>speedy death, yea, and cause us to
desire it, to pray for it?</p>
<p>On the contrary, do we not often find persons unspiritualised
by affliction?&nbsp; Do not many maintain that their worldly
troubles are the hindrance of religious thought and
practice?&nbsp; Is not death by very instinct shrunk from by
well-nigh all, and most by those whose circumstances seem to
recommend it as naturally the greatest good?</p>
<p>You hear those who are vexed or thwarted, or oppressed, or
wearied, exclaim in some moment of impatience or despondency,
&ldquo;I am weary of my life.&rdquo;&nbsp; You find some so worn
out, like Job, by long and accumulated troubles, that they
continually sigh, and from the heart, &ldquo;Oh! that I had given
up the ghost!&rdquo;&nbsp; You hear the thoughtless, the proud,
the obstinate, protest &ldquo;I had rather die.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
let them be taken at their word, let Death show himself to be
really close at hand, to be coming to them, and they will recoil
with horror from his touch, and piteously cry to be spared.&nbsp;
Occasionally one is found who, lacking patience and perseverance
to extricate himself lawfully from pressing difficulties, or, mad
with vexation because he cannot accomplish some worldly scheme,
or because he has been frustrated in some wickedness: or because
having <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>done the wickedness, he fears to face the worldly
consequences of his deed, not merely says that he wishes to die,
and prays for death; but then and there ministers it to
himself.&nbsp; Yet even in such cases, while he would escape from
life, he does not deliberately seek death.&nbsp; Nay, when he
finds he is encountering death, he often desists from his
half-done deed, or, if it be too late for that, shrieks
frantically for others to rescue him.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to all these rules, when men really wish
to die, when they deliberately court and procure death; but they
are sufficiently rare to vindicate the truth, that they are not
natural.</p>
<p>Certainly the desire and prayer of the first disciples to be
removed from this world were not natural.&nbsp; They did not
despair in difficulties.&nbsp; They were not unwilling to endure
continued trials and sufferings.&nbsp; They were not disgusted
with life.&nbsp; All that <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
required of them they burned to do; all that He laid upon them
they rejoiced to bear; and while aught was undone or unsuffered,
they chose and desired to remain; and even then, it was not
exhausted nature asking for rest, it was not weariness or dislike
of life&rsquo;s lot which prompted the prayer, &ldquo;Even so,
come, <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>:&rdquo; they gloried
in their then vocation, they <a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>loved their appointed work; they
would not relinquish it, they would not be unclothed, but clothed
upon, advanced, and perfected: they loved <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and so yearned to see Him; they
loved His service, and so coveted a state in which it could be
more fully and uninterruptedly rendered; they loved other men,
the alien and the outcast, and so longed for the day when all the
kingdoms of the world should become the kingdoms of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> and of His <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, when every soul should be subject to
and rejoice in His rule!&nbsp; They looked for <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> coming, not because they
supposed it would release them from His service, and transfer
them to an abode of luxurious immunity and rest and glory; but
because they thought it was the necessary prelude to full
usefulness, to entire submission to His will, to unremitted,
glorious service under His perceived eye, and in the perfection
of His strength.&nbsp; They thought death was gain, and they
desired it, not as the time of sleep, the chamber of inactivity
and oblivion, but as the door, the short passage, which led into
a world wherein the kingdom of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>
was fully set up, and wherein they should unceasingly experience
His rule, and act as its agents.&nbsp; They prayed that <span
class="smcap">God</span> would shortly accomplish the number of
His elect, not with the carnal desire <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>that their enemies might be
confounded, and that those then without might be kept without:
nor yet with selfish impatience for their own promised reward;
but that the work of grace might be effectual, where now it
seemed to be received in vain; that the darkness which
encompassed so many might be dispelled, that all Israel might be
saved, and might join them in glorifying <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>This was the feeling which prompted their Advent prayers; this
was the feeling which they laboured to arouse in those to whom
they spoke, and in us, for whom they wrote.&nbsp; When St. Paul
tells us, that to him to live was <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, and to die was gain, that he desired
to depart and be with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, though
he was content to remain, he shows one of the many respects in
which we are to be followers of him.&nbsp; When St. John records,
that he replied to <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
announcement, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Even
so, come, <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>,&rdquo; he
personates the Church and every acceptable member of it, and
shows us the attitude and the feeling which becomes each one of
those who wait for the <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span>
appearing; even as St. Peter does in direct appeal: &ldquo;What
manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and
godliness, looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of
<span class="smcap">God</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>Alas!
brethren, how far are we below the appointed standard of
acceptable discipleship!&nbsp; How little is <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> Second Advent in our minds,
even as a mere doctrine, a truth of Scripture!&nbsp; How small is
the influence which it is allowed to exercise on our thoughts and
affections, and lives!&nbsp; How seldom do we suggest to
ourselves the possibility of its nearness!&nbsp; How faintly, if
at all, in what mere words&mdash;words, which do not spring from
feelings, and are not illustrated by actions&mdash;do we pray for
its speedy arrival!</p>
<p>Even those among us, who are rightly mindful, who study to be
prepared at all times, lest speedily and suddenly the Son of Man
should come forth to judgment, or should send forth the angel of
death to bring them to His bar&mdash;even these can scarcely be
said to desire the coming, which they think of and prepare for:
much less to pray for it, and to do what in them lies to hasten
it.&nbsp; Even if we are faithful servants, able to render a
right account whenever it shall be called for, we dread rather
than hope for the day of our <span
class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s</span> return.&nbsp; Even if we have
our lamps trimmed and oil with us in our vessels, if instead of
slumbering, we are watching, would it not still be to us an
unwelcome cry, &ldquo;Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to
meet Him&rdquo;?&nbsp; <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>What would be the first feeling of
the best of us, if at this moment an angel stood revealed, and
announced &ldquo;The day of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>
is come&rdquo;? which of us can honestly, heartily say now,
&ldquo;I would not live always.&nbsp; I would not live till
to-morrow, if <span class="smcap">God</span> graciously willed
that I might die to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course there are many reasons why we should shrink from an
immediate advent.&nbsp; We all of us need to cast off some works
of darkness: something is wanting in the spiritual armour of the
best accoutred.&nbsp; We feel that we have much work to do for
<span class="smcap">God</span> before the night cometh; we have
many graces to cultivate and many others to acquire, before we
shall be fit for <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
coming; and, besides, naturally, the unprovided for, the
unprotected, the unguided, that will be left behind, if we go,
tempt us to linger, with eyes earthwards; and fashion chains to
bind us down.&nbsp; But setting aside all this, supposing it all
changed, so that we were fit in all other respects for heaven,
and nothing and no one on earth really required us, does not
conscience convince us that still we would rather not go yet,
that we shall be the better pleased the longer we are allowed to
stay, that our real prayer (that which our feelings suggest,
though our mouths dare not utter it, nor our <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>minds dwell
on it) is &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lord Jesus</span>, come
<i>not</i> quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is this?&nbsp; I do not mean why is it in the case of the
wilful, the sensual, the worldly&mdash;there is no need to ask
the question of them; <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span>
coming will be their utter confusion, and the immediate
forerunner of their destruction.&nbsp; It is easy to understand
why <i>they</i> wish him to delay.&nbsp; But why is it in the
case of the truly penitent, the reformed, the faithful, the holy,
the comparatively ready for <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> kingdom of glory?&nbsp; The
foremost reason seems to be that they have never had the courage
to meditate calmly and sufficiently on death.&nbsp; The first
thought of death alarms them.&nbsp; And this is natural, for
death is part of the punishment of sin, and all that reminds of
sin should alarm.&nbsp; But it is only the <i>first</i> thought
that alarms.&nbsp; If they would give it further consideration,
they would see that death is deprived of his sting, that, monster
as he appears, to them he is harmless.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no
condemnation for them that are in <span class="smcap">Christ
Jesus</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Death is not their enemy, but their
friend.&nbsp; In fact, he is death no longer.&nbsp; He is an
appointed minister to take them out of what might be more
properly called death&mdash;this mortal life&mdash;and introduce
them into real life.&nbsp; He does not separate them from <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, but joins them <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>more truly
to Him.&nbsp; It is not a dark, bottomless pit, with sides that
cannot be climbed, to which he brings them, but a short valley
leading from the plain of this world to the city of glory, which
he that enters passes through in a moment, ay, and less than a
moment, and is new born for eternity.&nbsp; Bring yourselves,
brethren, to believe this, to feel the reality of it, to be sure
that the moment your body falls asleep in <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> your spirit is wafted to Paradise, and
begins to rest consciously on <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
and to company with the spirits of the just departed.&nbsp; Then,
though the nearness of death may for the moment awe
you&mdash;because it is the antechamber which leads directly into
the presence of so much holiness and glory&mdash;it will have no
power to fill you with dismay, no undesirableness to make you
shrink from it.&nbsp; No, brethren, you will think much of it,
you will patiently hope for it, you will anticipate it and watch
for it, and when it draws nigh, you will welcome it with joy, and
hasten to be transferred by it from mortal life to immortal!</p>
<p>Another fault is, that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> is
not sufficiently in all our thoughts.&nbsp; Our religion is too
much of mere routine; our obedience is mechanical, unintelligent;
our holiness is acquired, because of an imposed necessity; our
faith is but historical.&nbsp; <a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>We do not feel what St. Paul felt
when he said, &ldquo;To me to live is <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; By which it is clear he
meant much more than that <span
class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> service was his one
employment, <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> rewards his
one expectation, <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> grace
his only strength.&nbsp; He did not simply look back to a
crucified Saviour, nor forward to a coming Judge, believing
himself to be made a servant, and to have by and by to render an
account, to be liable to a judgment of his service; but meanwhile
to have no <span class="smcap">Lord</span> near and over
him.&nbsp; No! the <span class="smcap">Christ</span> that had
departed in the flesh was felt to have come back in the
spirit.&nbsp; St. Paul saw Him by faith, knew Him, walked side by
side with Him, served Him personally, derived constant grace from
Him, loved Him, and felt His love.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> was the Alpha and Omega of his being,
the beginning, the motive power of all his thoughts, and words,
and deeds, the companion of all his ways, the object of all his
aims: <span class="smcap">Christ</span> the power of <span
class="smcap">God</span> unto salvation, <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> a very present help and comfort,
<span class="smcap">Christ</span> the hope of glory.&nbsp; Life
was full of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> in its experiences,
its aims, its delights, and hopes.&nbsp; Gladly, therefore, would
he retain it as long as <span class="smcap">God</span> willed;
but knowing that death was gain, that after death <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> would be more palpably with him, that
he would be more able <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>to appreciate <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, that heavenly joys would then be
added to the joys he had on earth, he still longed for his
departure, he desired ardently to be clothed upon, he loved the
thought of <span class="smcap">Christ&rsquo;s</span> final
appearing, and his whole life acted the prayer which St. John
uttered, &ldquo;Come, <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brethren, you must live as Paul did, you must appreciate life
as he did, if you would desire death as he did.&nbsp; You must
acquaint yourselves with <span class="smcap">Christ</span> by
study and meditation, by the Spirit&rsquo;s invoked aid.&nbsp;
You must think of a living <span class="smcap">Lord</span> as
well as of a dead Saviour.&nbsp; You must have reference in all
your ways, not only to the first advent and to the last, but,
also, and I would even say chiefly, to the constant advent.&nbsp;
You must have come to perceive that the promise is fulfilled,
&ldquo;Lo, I am with you alway.&rdquo;&nbsp; You must endure as
seeing Him who is invisible.&nbsp; You must carry <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> about with you.&nbsp; You must do all
to the glory of Him, felt to be near, to be served and
glorified.&nbsp; When you would go anywhither, your first thought
must be, &ldquo;Will <span class="smcap">Christ</span> accompany
me?&nbsp; Except thy presence go with me, O <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, carry me not up hence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
When you have aught to do or suffer, your realisation of a near
and available helper must make you begin with <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>the prayer,
&ldquo;O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, raise up thy power and
come among us, and with great might succour us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Gratitude for benefits provided so long ago will never prompt you
to render due Christian service, vague expectation of
inconceivable joys will never quicken your steps Zionwards.&nbsp;
You must know <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, feel Him,
converse with Him, depend on Him, and then, while you enjoy the
life here, you will yet yearn for a place and a condition where
you can have perfectly and uninterruptedly what now for so many
reasons you have but in small part, and, &ldquo;Thy kingdom
come,&rdquo; &ldquo;Even so, come, <span class="smcap">Lord
Jesus</span>,&rdquo; will be your fervent and frequent
prayers.</p>
<p>I have spoken all along as if what we call &ldquo;death&rdquo;
were the coming of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, which you
ought to desire and pray for, because we have all come to take
for granted that in our several cases death will surely precede
judgment, that <span class="smcap">Christ</span> will not be
revealed in our time.&nbsp; I need scarcely remind you, that we
do not know that; that at any moment the final advent might take
place, and so each one of us be caught up alive&mdash;and never
see death.&nbsp; If then, when you desire more of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, you think that through the gate of
death is the probable way of gaining it, and so look for death,
you must not forget that there is another <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>way, and
that you may possibly first meet <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> face to face there.&nbsp; Be your
desire to be more fully with <span class="smcap">Christ</span>,
and submissively leave to Him to decide how that desire shall be
accomplished, through death or without death.&nbsp; But in either
case remember that your ultimate thought should rest upon the
final advent, and your most fervent prayers be for it.&nbsp;
Though you gain much by dying, being freed from many hindrances
of perception of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, being made
more fit for His presence, seeing Him more clearly, feeling, and
hearing, and loving Him better, your state and privileges will
still be imperfect.&nbsp; You must stand before Him in glorified
bodies before you are capable of being and receiving all that He
graciously designs; and all the elect must stand there with you
before His perfect gifts shall be bestowed.&nbsp; God does not
will that we, without them, should be made perfect.&nbsp; The
final advent, then, is to be the frequent subject of our prayers;
the speedy completion of all God&rsquo;s preparatory measures,
the swiftest communication, far and wide, of the knowledge of His
name and will, the quick filling up of the number of the
elect.</p>
<p>This we are to pray for, and this we are to aid in
accomplishing.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Christ</span> will come
when all is ready, and He has left us to make ready.&nbsp; First
<a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>to
prepare ourselves, then to prepare others.&nbsp; When this work
of the forerunner has been done, the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> Whom ye seek will come.&nbsp; He does
but tarry till men be told of His coming, and persuaded to look
for and desire it.&nbsp; When we tell them, when we persuade
them, we hasten His coming&mdash;that coming in perfect glory to
bestow in perfection on us, on all, that which, till then, at the
best must be imperfect.</p>
<p>Should not this quicken our own growth in spiritual things?
should it not prompt us to admonish, and persuade, and help
others? should it not impel us to give more substantial aid to,
to interest ourselves more about, to pray more frequently and
really for the success of missionary enterprise, that those who
have heard of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> may be found out
in their forgetfulness, and reminded of Him, that those who are
as yet strangers and aliens may be brought into His household,
and made fellow heirs with us, and expectants of His coming?</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>The</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>was with Joseph</i>, <i>and he was a
prosperous man</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you were asked, brethren, to
make a list of what you consider prosperous men, what kind of
persons what you put into it?&nbsp; Those, I doubt not, with whom
all goes smoothly, who come in no misfortune like other folk, who
have riches in possession, acquire fame, are exalted in honour;
whose wishes are largely gratified, whose every project succeeds;
who, in short, experience no reverse, no temporary withdrawal or
suspension of good fortune, and peace, and pleasure.&nbsp; What
is the first prosperous man that comes into your mind?&nbsp;
Perhaps, a successful speculator, who years ago made what is
called a &ldquo;lucky hit,&rdquo; and has gone on repeating it,
till he has become a <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>millionaire.&nbsp; Perhaps, a
professional man, whom fortune took by the hand as soon as he set
out, and who has been hurried along with giant strides, favoured,
flattered, well remunerated, till he has reached the summit of
success.&nbsp; Perhaps, some uniformly thriving, respectable,
happy tradesman, whose business prospers, who is always able to
pay his way, can afford time and money for pleasure, and has good
heart and health to enjoy it; in whose household there is no
strife or division, no sickness, no vacated place; all present
success, or bright hope.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, you fasten on an
artisan, who is never out of work, who always meets with
considerate and liberal employers, whose sobriety and
uprightness, and other good qualities, are recognised and
respected abroad, and rewarded by comfort, and affection, and
well-doing at home.</p>
<p>But it is a clergyman who bids you select: so you must look
about with a religious eye.&nbsp; Then you pick out, perhaps,
those who are naturally endowed with good will and resolution,
and are strong to perform it; who have been early trained in the
right way, so that doing good has become habitual and
comparatively easy; who have no overwhelming concern about the
support of their lower life, are not distracted by worldly cares
or <a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 307</span>by
the claims of society upon them, nor much exposed to unspiritual
influence; who have no immoderate passions, encounter no sore
temptations, but <i>can</i>, without hindrance, and <i>do</i>,
from desire, live calm, and easy, and creditable lives.&nbsp;
These, you would say, are prosperous men, and so, in a sense,
they are&mdash;very prosperous&mdash;and far be it from me to
say, wrongly, or unhappily prosperous.&nbsp; We know, indeed,
what snares riches bring with them, how many grave
responsibilities are imposed upon all to whom much has been
given, how dizzy one becomes through standing on a great height,
and how easy and dangerous it is to fall from it.&nbsp; We know,
too, that constant success is apt to make us self-reliant,
forgetful of <span class="smcap">God</span>, proud, imperious,
uncharitable; and that uninterrupted peace and happiness in this
world too often beguile us, softly indeed, but surely, out of all
thought of heaven.&nbsp; And once more, we know that an even
temperament and an untempted life may easily lead to
routine-religion, to self-righteousness, to spiritual apathy and
deadness.&nbsp; On these accounts, we must not count them
<i>surely</i> happy who prosper in the world; but, on the other
hand, we may not judge their state certainly unhappy; nor deem
the desire to be like them necessarily wrong or unwise.&nbsp;
<i>If</i> we can make <a name="page308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>sure of both worlds; <i>if</i> we
can have the best of this, and not lose the other; <i>if</i> no
harm will happen to our spiritual state, and no fitness for it be
unattained and unkept; <i>if</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>
will be surely with us, while we <i>thus</i> prosper&mdash;then
religion does not require, rather forbids, that we should give up
our good things, that we should forbear to seek them, to use
them, and to rejoice in them.&nbsp; All these various states may,
or may not be, truly prosperous.&nbsp; Wherefore be not rashly
carried away with admiration and desire of any of them; be slow
to judge unfavourably of them, or to refuse, if you be called to
any of them.</p>
<p>But what I would have you chiefly note now is that there are
other kinds of true prosperity; rather, that if you would find
out who truly prosper, and whether you yourselves are truly
prosperous, you must look for other signs than those of worldly
success and happiness; you must not conclude that the inward
part, the very substance of prosperity, is wanting, because the
outward life is sorely tried, and thwarted, and deprived, and
saddened.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Truth describes, in the chapter of the text, a
truly prosperous man.&nbsp; Three several times, in a few verses,
is Joseph&rsquo;s prosperity put prominently forward.&nbsp; Now
just think what his <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>life had been, and was, and was yet
to be!&nbsp; He had been motherless from an early age; his
father&rsquo;s love made him the object of his brothers&rsquo;
envy and hatred.&nbsp; He was thrown into a pit to die, and only
escaped death to become a slave in a foreign land to a heathen
master.&nbsp; Ere long he was made the victim of a foul
accusation; he was thrust into prison, and there detained many
long years; and when, at last, a hope of deliverance dawned upon
him, he was cruelly disappointed by the king&rsquo;s servant,
whom he had kindly tended and reassured in trouble, and another
two years of incarceration, of suspense worse than despair, had
to be endured!&nbsp; Yet was he <i>all the while</i>&mdash;mark
that!&mdash;a prosperous man.&nbsp; The Scripture does not say or
mean that <i>by and by</i> he attained to a prosperity, in which
all his former adversity was forgotten.&nbsp; It is of the
present, not of the future, that prosperity is predicated.&nbsp;
Nor may we suppose that there was but a <i>show</i> of adversity,
that Joseph was really what we call prosperous all the while, in
that he enjoyed many advantages, that he made steady way towards
greatness, that his troubles were but as the toils and
difficulties which, in a measure, the most successful have to
encounter; or the just merits of misdeeds and the correction of
faults.&nbsp; Up to the time of his release <a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>from
prison, all through the years which Scripture says were
prosperous, every hope and aim had been frustrated.&nbsp; It was
not that he had difficulty in entering upon his work, that he had
much to resist and suffer from its pursuit; but that after it was
done, the reward of it was denied him: he only climbed the hill,
to be rolled back, just as he reached the summit.&nbsp; His
child&rsquo;s life commended him to the love of his father,
<i>therefore</i> he was thrust out.&nbsp; He won the good-will of
his master, was diligent in his work, which prospered in his
hand; was trustworthy and trusted, rose to be overseer of the
house, and <i>then</i>, when he had good hope of his freedom and
of returning to his yearned-for home, without any fault of his,
he was degraded, branded with infamy, and cast into prison.&nbsp;
Here, again, he deserved prosperity: the very jailor acknowledged
it, and honoured and well treated him.&nbsp; The door, too,
seemed to be opening for his deliverance, when a fellow-prisoner
went forth full of his praise, an eye-witness of his sorrow, to
make mention of him to Pharaoh&mdash;but alas! the most strange
forgetfulness took possession of the butler, and for two years
the name of Joseph never crossed his lips, nor thought of him
entered his mind.&nbsp; And even when delivered out of prison,
and exalted by Pharaoh, he became but <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>a chief <i>slave</i>, next the
throne in dignity, second to the king in power, but still not
free to return to his home, still kept ignorant whether his
father was yet alive!&nbsp; Was this what we can call, by any
stretch or limitation, &ldquo;prosperity&rdquo;?&nbsp; And mark,
that all his trouble came upon him, not only <i>in</i>, but
<i>for</i>, his well-doing.&nbsp; In obedience to his father, he
went to visit his brethren, and thus afforded the occasion of
selling him into bondage; because he did his duty to Potiphar, he
was put into circumstances of danger; by refusing to sin against
<span class="smcap">God</span>, he incurred the reproach and
punishment of sin; by honestly asserting before Pharaoh,
&ldquo;It is not in me, I am nothing but a servant,&rdquo; he
lost the opportunity of obtaining what the king would have been
most ready to give him, and afraid to refuse, absolute
freedom.</p>
<p>My brethren, you and I can hardly bear with trials, and
sufferings, and reproaches, and ill-treatment, when we dimly
suspect, or are actually conscious, that we have deserved
them.&nbsp; How should we murmur, and cry out, and kick, and
rebel, if we were thus treated for well-doing!&nbsp; With what
words should we answer him who sought to calm and comfort us in
such trouble, by assuring us that we did wrong to count it
adversity, that it was indeed prosperity!</p>
<p><a name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>Yet
<span class="smcap">God</span> says that Joseph was a prosperous
man.&nbsp; It is evident, therefore, that we know not the meaning
of prosperity, and must search in His dictionary for the
interpretation of it.&nbsp; It is soon found: the first part of
the text supplies it&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The</i> <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>was with him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! here is light from heaven.&nbsp; Prosperity does not mean
the state of careless independence; being what we will, having
what we desire, accomplishing what we propose: it means, the
state of dependence, of being kept and ordered by <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> providence, treated as He wills,
used in accomplishing His purposes.&nbsp; <i>By right</i>, we are
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>, by creation, and
redemption, and sanctification, sent into this world, reconciled
and restored after defection, enabled and commissioned to do the
will of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; We are as much the
agents of His purposes as the elements, or any other of His
creatures; and it would be just as reasonable, were it possible,
for the sun to complain that it is sometimes covered with clouds;
the rain, that it has to descend and be absorbed in the earth, or
lost in the sea, or scattered in snow; the wind, that it must
blow when and where He pleases, as for us to say of any state
into which we are brought, of any work to which we are put, or of
any calling off from it, &ldquo;I like not this; I am <a
name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 313</span>not
prospered.&nbsp; All these things are against me&rdquo;!&nbsp; We
have no right to independence; we ought not to be independent,
and if we are, it is either because we have forsaken our
appointed service, or because <span class="smcap">God</span>
deems us unfit for it, and, therefore, uses us not!&nbsp; A chief
part of Joseph&rsquo;s prosperity, remember, consisted not in the
advancement of himself, but in the accomplishment of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> work: &ldquo;<i>That which he
did</i>, the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made it to
prosper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But <i>by privilege</i>, as well as by right, are we <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span>.&nbsp; We are not mere tools in
His hand: we are living agents, intelligent to understand His
will, free to do it or decline it, capable of loving it.&nbsp; We
are, therefore, taken into His counsel, made fellow-workers with
Him, treated all along by Him according to our merits, finally
rewarded according to our work; not, however, in the way of our
own choice, but of His.&nbsp; O if we realised this, and did our
part according to the belief, we should never murmur at, or
question anything that is appointed us, or befals us.&nbsp; For
what does such questioning amount to, but an assertion that <span
class="smcap">God</span> does not make the right use of us, or
that He does not treat us worthily?&nbsp; And what is that, but
to deny His wisdom, His justice, and His love?&nbsp; No man, who
is worth a thought, counts it <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>adversity, that he is bound by the
conditions, and must accept the trials, and do the work of his
chosen earthly calling, that he is obliged, for instance, to
serve in his shop, or pore over his books, or risk storms at sea,
or face the dangers of war; that, in short, he cannot be and do
what he will, but must obey the law of circumstances&mdash;why,
then, should he reverse all this in his divine mission and
heavenly calling, and demand a liberty, an immunity, a choice,
which common sense would tell him should not and could not be
granted?</p>
<p>But there is another, a chief consideration, which should
incline us to be sure that the ordering of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> providence is the conferring of
True Prosperity.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> uses us,
indeed, as servants, and appoints us our individual work out of
the several circumstances around us.&nbsp; But He likewise makes
us His friends, and uses the circumstances around us, as
ministers to us.&nbsp; It is in them that He speaks to us and
visits us; it is by them, that He rewards and punishes us now; it
is through them that He disciplines and trains us, and perfects
us for heaven.&nbsp; We were not made for them, but they for
us.&nbsp; And what shall we be saying of the Artificer and the
Superintendent of their use if we question their general fitness,
or the special application of them to ourselves?&nbsp; <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>&ldquo;Sorrow is not good for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am ruined by that disappointment.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Through
taking that stay from me, I am become helpless.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Removing me thither is overwhelming me with
adversity.&rdquo;&nbsp; These, my brethren, are not only the
expressions of ingratitude, and the reasonings of unbelief, they
are the dictations of arrogant presumption dethroning the wisdom
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and putting our folly in its
place.&nbsp; We have no right to choose for ourselves: and if we
had, how could we do it?&nbsp; Is not <span
class="smcap">God</span> wise to know what is best for us?&nbsp;
Is not He good to apply it?&nbsp; Should we not fear the
fulfilment of any hope, the accomplishment of any purpose of our
own, and cry, &ldquo;O <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, not as I
will, but as Thou wilt.&nbsp; Except Thy presence go with me,
carry me not up hence&rdquo;!&nbsp; Should we not accept with
full resignation, with heartfelt gratitude, any imposed
condition, and say, &ldquo;It is the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>, let Him do what seemeth Him
good,&rdquo; &ldquo;It is good for me to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may reason this out, and the example of others proves it,
and our own experience confirms it.&nbsp; Admit the fact, that
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> was with Joseph, <i>i.e.</i>,
that He used him as His agent, that He loved him, and designed to
deliver him from evil, and to bless him to the uttermost; and
then look along his life to see whether wisdom and love <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>did not
guide all his circumstances to this end.&nbsp; It was <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> will that Joseph should cause
Jacob to come into Egypt, and should sustain him there.&nbsp; How
every step of his seeming adversity helped to accomplish this
will!&nbsp; The telling of his dream engendered the hatred of his
brethren; that hatred sold him to the Midianites, the Midianites
brought him to Potiphar, the false accusation cast him into
prison, in the prison he interpreted the king&rsquo;s
butler&rsquo;s dream, and therefore he was summoned to interpret
the king&rsquo;s dream, and for so doing made the ruler of Egypt,
and the dispenser of corn to the famished nations.&nbsp; This
brought the sons of Jacob to him: this enabled him to dispose of
them according to the will of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; Thus, &ldquo;that which he did
the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> made it to
prosper.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then of his personal prosperity.&nbsp;
Was not his father&rsquo;s preference likely to spoil him?&nbsp;
Did he not run daily risks from the hatred of his brethren?&nbsp;
Was his best state that of an honoured slave in Potiphar&rsquo;s
household?&nbsp; Was it well that he should daily encounter the
temptations of his mistress?&nbsp; Was there no good discipline
in that prison-life?&nbsp; Did not deliverance come at the
fitting moment, rightly so late, under such circumstances?&nbsp;
Supposing he had chosen for himself, what else could he have
chosen that <a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>would have been better, or as good as <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> choice for Him?&nbsp; And if,
brethren, we look along <i>our</i> lives in the light of <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> providence, is it not just so
with us?&nbsp; Supposing us to be faithful servants of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, has not all that has happened to us
been for our good?&nbsp; Was it not well for us that we were
removed from the state in which we were being spoiled, becoming
selfish and proud?&nbsp; Was it not good for us to be
afflicted?&nbsp; Did not some earthly loss make us seek to fill
the void with heavenly consolation?&nbsp; Are we not now
better&mdash;better in fact&mdash;better in hope&mdash;because
<span class="smcap">God</span> has prospered us in His own way,
than if we had had what <i>we</i> thought prosperity?&nbsp; Yes,
surely; and had we been wise, in the hour of our worst trial, we
should have known that we were truly prosperous, in that <span
class="smcap">God</span> was with us, that His jealous love had
taken us from the foolish fondness that was spoiling us, from the
bitter envy that would not rest till it had destroyed us, from
the secular prosperity that would soon have made us forget our
birthright, from the temptation that sought to defile us!</p>
<p>If we have been wanting in this wisdom hitherto, let us fill
ourselves with it now.&nbsp; Let us accept everything that befals
us in the path of faith and obedience as true prosperity; true
prosperity, <a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>not only because it is accomplishing by us <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> wise purposes, not only because
it is advancing us to glory, but because, it is the felt, the
immediate, wise, loving operation on us of a present <span
class="smcap">God</span>, present to sustain, to comfort, to
sanctify, to bless, present under a better covenant than that
with Joseph, present more graciously, and more effectually; <span
class="smcap">God</span> the Father of our <span
class="smcap">Lord Jesus Christ</span>, <span
class="smcap">God</span> the Son, who has given Himself for us,
and has promised to be with us always even to the end of the
world, <span class="smcap">God</span> the Holy Ghost, proceeding
from the Father and the Son, bringing near and applying true
prosperity, and fitting us for it, and enlightening us to see it,
and causing us to rejoice in it.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
